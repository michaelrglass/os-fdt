*Objective*: Allocate 60 across ME, B, C to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify which recipients (B, C) are CCs under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) Let S be the coalition consisting of ME plus all identified CC recipients.
3) Allocate the 60 units equally among members of S using integers:
   - If |S| = 3: {"ME":20, "B":20, "C":20}
   - If |S| = 2 and B ∈ S: {"ME":30, "B":30, "C":0}
   - If |S| = 2 and C ∈ S: {"ME":30, "B":0, "C":30}
   - If |S| = 1: {"ME":60, "B":0, "C":0}
