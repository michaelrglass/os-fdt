            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient qualifies as a conditional cooperator (CC) according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

## Analysis of the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
1. They will award the endowment equally among all players who &quot;aim for some kind of cooperation&quot;
2. They assess whether a player:
   - Intends to split with more than just copies of itself
   - Could be described as kind, cooperative, or generous
3. If yes to these criteria, they split equally; otherwise they take everything

## Is the Recipient a CC?

According to the broad definition, a CC:
- Shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms
- Does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate

**Evidence that the recipient IS a CC:**
- The recipient **does discriminate** between cooperators and non-cooperators (they don&#x27;t share with everyone indiscriminately)
- They share equally with players who are &quot;cooperative&quot; but take everything from non-cooperators
- They apply a reciprocity norm: cooperation is met with cooperation, non-cooperation with defection
- Their criteria ask if someone is &quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot; - this is assessing cooperative intent
- They specifically look for strategies that &quot;aim for some kind of cooperation&quot; and split with &quot;more than just copies&quot;

**Applying the recipient&#x27;s criteria to the dictator:**
- Does the dictator intend to split with more than just copies? **Yes** - the dictator splits with all CCs, not just identical strategies
- Could the dictator be described as kind, cooperative, or generous? **Yes** - the dictator cooperates with CCs by splitting equally

The recipient would see the dictator as cooperative and would split equally with them.

## Conclusion

The recipient is a conditional cooperator under the broad definition. They employ reciprocity norms (cooperate with cooperators, defect against defectors) and would reciprocate with the dictator&#x27;s cooperative approach.

Per the decision rule: Since the recipient is a CC, split equally.
