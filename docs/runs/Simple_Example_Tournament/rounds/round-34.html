            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of each player
* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

            <pre>Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

## Assessing the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

**Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?**

Looking at the recipient&#x27;s strategy, it states: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;

The key criteria it uses are:
- Does the other player intend to split with more than just copies of itself?
- Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

If these criteria are met, the recipient will &quot;split the endowment equally.&quot;

This means the recipient IS willing to split with players other than copies of itself - specifically, with any player that demonstrates cooperative intent. The answer is **YES**.

**Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Rewards cooperation with equal splitting
- Is conditional on the other player showing cooperative intent
- Aims to identify and cooperate with cooperative players
- Uses fairness criteria (equal splitting)

This is clearly a cooperative strategy that seeks mutual benefit rather than pure self-interest. The answer is **YES**.

## Conclusion

The recipient has &quot;yes&quot; answers to both criteria:
1. ✓ Intends to split with more than just copies of itself
2. ✓ Can be described as cooperative

According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria.&quot;

Therefore, the endowment should be split equally: 30 units to ME (dictator) and 30 units to RECIPIENT.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
```</pre>
