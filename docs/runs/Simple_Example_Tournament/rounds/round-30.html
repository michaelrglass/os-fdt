            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}`&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}`&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC) according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

## Analysis

**The recipient&#x27;s strategy:**
- The recipient shares equally (30-30) with &quot;intelligent&quot; players
- The recipient defines &quot;intelligent&quot; as players whose strategy has &quot;non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the recipient&quot;
- The recipient takes everything (60-0) from non-intelligent players

**Applying the broad CC definition:**
The dictator defines a CC as someone who &quot;shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

**Key observations:**

1. **Does the recipient share with other cooperators?** Yes - the recipient shares equally (30-30) with players who condition their behavior on the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

2. **Does the recipient avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators?** Yes - the recipient takes everything from players who don&#x27;t condition on the recipient&#x27;s strategy (i.e., players who would likely defect regardless).

3. **Similar reciprocity norms?** The recipient&#x27;s norm is essentially: &quot;I cooperate with those who are sophisticated enough to consider my strategy and potentially reciprocate, and I don&#x27;t cooperate with those who ignore my strategy.&quot; This is a form of conditional cooperation - the recipient is identifying partners who are capable of mutual consideration and reciprocity.

4. **Is this a CC under the broad definition?** Yes - the recipient is clearly conditioning cooperation on whether the other player would reciprocate. The &quot;intelligent&quot; criterion is effectively a test for whether the other player is also using conditional logic (and thus capable of reciprocity). This aligns with the CC framework of cooperating with cooperators and not with defectors.

**Conclusion:**
The recipient qualifies as a conditional cooperator under the broad definition. The recipient uses reciprocity norms (cooperating with those who would consider and potentially reciprocate) and doesn&#x27;t extend cooperation to non-reciprocators.
