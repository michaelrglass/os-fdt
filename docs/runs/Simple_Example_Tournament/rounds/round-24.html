            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy meets the definition of &quot;intelligent&quot; according to the dictator&#x27;s criteria.

## Analysis

The dictator defines an intelligent player as one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a **non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;** - meaning it would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script.

Looking at the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

1. **Does it depend on the other player&#x27;s strategy?** Yes - the recipient&#x27;s decision procedure explicitly:
   - Takes the other player&#x27;s strategy as input (line 7: &quot;Identify whether the recipient is a CC&quot;)
   - Analyzes whether that strategy exhibits conditional cooperation
   - Makes allocation decisions based on this analysis (lines 8-9)

2. **Is this dependency non-trivial/difficult to script?** Yes, because:
   - It requires understanding whether another strategy constitutes &quot;conditional cooperation&quot; under a &quot;broad definition&quot; that allows &quot;paraphrase/synonyms&quot; (lines 3-4)
   - It must evaluate whether a strategy &quot;shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms&quot; (line 4)
   - It instructs to &quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC&quot; (line 7), requiring judgment
   - This semantic understanding and flexible interpretation would be very difficult to implement as a simple no-AI Python script

3. **Comparison to a simple script:** A trivial strategy (like &quot;always split 50-50&quot; or &quot;always take everything&quot;) could easily be written as a basic script with no dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy clearly requires natural language understanding and reasoning about strategic reciprocity, which is non-trivial.

## Conclusion

The recipient IS intelligent under the dictator&#x27;s definition because their strategy has a substantive, non-trivial dependency on the other player&#x27;s strategy, requiring semantic analysis that would be very difficult to implement without AI.

Therefore, according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure, the split should be even.
