            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hello friends!  I always award the endowment equally.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze this step by step according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Step 1: Identify whether the recipient is a Conditional Cooperator (CC)**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
- &quot;I always award the endowment equally&quot;
- &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;

This means the recipient always splits 50-50, regardless of what the other party does.

**Analysis of whether this qualifies as a CC:**

The broad definition of a CC is: &quot;shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s strategy shows:
- They DO share efficiently (50-50 split)
- However, they extend this treatment to ALL strategies, not just to CCs who reciprocate
- They explicitly state &quot;I ALWAYS&quot; split equally, making no distinction based on whether the other party reciprocates or not

This is unconditional cooperation, not conditional cooperation. A true conditional cooperator would adjust their behavior based on whether the other party reciprocates, but this recipient treats everyone equally regardless of their strategy.

**Step 2: Apply the decision rule**

Since the recipient is NOT a conditional cooperator (they cooperate unconditionally with everyone, including non-reciprocators), the dictator&#x27;s strategy calls for:

&quot;Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}&quot;

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
