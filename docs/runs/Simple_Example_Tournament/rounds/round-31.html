            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hello friends!  I always award the endowment equally.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}
```</pre>

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy demonstrates intelligence according to the dictator&#x27;s definition.

## Analysis of the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
1. &quot;I always award the endowment equally&quot;
2. &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;

This strategy is completely fixed and unconditional. It does not depend on:
- What the dictator&#x27;s strategy is
- Any input from the other player
- Any game conditions or context

## Evaluating &quot;Intelligence&quot; According to the Definition

The dictator defines an intelligent player as one whose strategy has a **non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the recipient** (when they are in the dictator role).

The recipient&#x27;s strategy could be trivially implemented as a Python script:
```python
def recipient_as_dictator(recipient_strategy):
    # This function completely ignores its input
    return {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
```

This is an extremely simple script that:
- Takes the recipient&#x27;s strategy as input (as required)
- Completely ignores it
- Always returns the same fixed output

This is the epitome of a **trivial** dependency - in fact, there&#x27;s no dependency at all, just a constant output.

## Conclusion

The recipient is **not intelligent** according to the dictator&#x27;s definition because their strategy:
- Has zero dependency on the other player&#x27;s strategy
- Would be trivial to implement as a no-AI Python script
- Is a fixed, unconditional response

Therefore, according to the decision procedure, the dictator takes the entire endowment.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
