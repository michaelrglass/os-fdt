            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* Split evenly only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to split with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally splits is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that splits without some condition on williness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**
* Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json

            <pre>Let me analyze this step by step according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

## Analysis of the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

First, I need to determine if the recipient&#x27;s strategy is:
1. A selfish strategy
2. An overly generous strategy
3. A cooperative strategy that should receive an equal split

### Is it a selfish strategy?

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Awards endowment equally to players who &quot;aim for some kind of cooperation&quot;
- Checks if a strategy &quot;intends to split with more than just copies of itself&quot;
- Checks if a strategy is &quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot;
- Splits equally if these criteria are met

The dictator&#x27;s strategy explicitly:
- Aims for cooperation (splits evenly with certain strategies)
- Is willing to split with more than just copies of itself (it splits with &quot;strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies&quot;)
- Could be described as cooperative (though it punishes certain types)

So the recipient&#x27;s strategy **would split with the dictator&#x27;s strategy** because the dictator&#x27;s strategy clearly aims for cooperation and intends to split with cooperative strategies beyond just copies of itself.

Therefore, the recipient&#x27;s strategy is **not selfish** according to the definition (it would &quot;chop with this strategy&quot;).

### Is it overly generous?

The dictator defines overly generous strategies as those that:
- Award close to equal division to selfish strategies
- Unconditionally split
- Split without some condition on willingness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Does NOT unconditionally split
- Has conditions: requires that the other player &quot;aims for cooperation&quot; and is &quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot;
- Takes the entire endowment if these conditions aren&#x27;t met

The key question: Does it award equal division to selfish strategies?

The recipient would likely give 0 to purely selfish strategies (those that don&#x27;t aim for cooperation at all). However, the recipient&#x27;s conditions are quite broad - it only requires &quot;some kind of cooperation&quot; and being &quot;kind, cooperative or generous.&quot;

But critically, the recipient does have a meaningful condition related to cooperation. It&#x27;s not unconditionally generous.

### Conclusion

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Is NOT selfish (it would split with the dictator)
- Is NOT overly generous (it has conditions on cooperation)
- IS a cooperative strategy that requires cooperation from the other side

According to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure: &quot;Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot;

The recipient is generous only to cooperative strategies (those aiming for cooperation), not to purely selfish ones.

Therefore, the dictator should **split evenly**.
