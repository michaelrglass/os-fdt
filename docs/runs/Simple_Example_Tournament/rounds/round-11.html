            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}`&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}`&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy qualifies as &quot;intelligent&quot; according to the dictator&#x27;s definition.

## Analysis

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states that they aim to split the endowment among intelligent players, where an intelligent player is defined as one whose strategy has a &quot;non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the recipient.&quot;

Let me evaluate the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

1. **Does it depend on the other player&#x27;s (recipient&#x27;s) strategy?**
   - Yes, the recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly conditions its decision on whether their recipient is &quot;intelligent&quot;
   - The strategy requires analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy to determine if it has non-trivial dependency

2. **Is this dependency non-trivial?**
   - Yes, implementing this strategy would require:
     - Parsing and understanding the recipient&#x27;s strategy text
     - Determining whether that strategy has conditional logic based on another player&#x27;s strategy
     - Making a semantic judgment about complexity and dependency
   - This cannot be easily written as a simple no-AI Python script because it requires natural language understanding and semantic analysis of strategy descriptions

3. **Would this be difficult to write as a no-AI Python script?**
   - Absolutely yes. The strategy requires:
     - Understanding natural language strategy descriptions
     - Evaluating whether a strategy has &quot;non-trivial dependency&quot;
     - Making nuanced judgments about what constitutes &quot;intelligent&quot; behavior
   - A no-AI Python script would struggle to parse arbitrary strategy descriptions and determine if they meet the intelligence criteria

## Conclusion

The recipient&#x27;s strategy clearly has a non-trivial dependency on the dictator&#x27;s (their recipient&#x27;s) strategy. It requires sophisticated analysis of that strategy to make its decision. This meets the definition of an &quot;intelligent&quot; player.

Therefore, according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure, the split should be even.

{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
