            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}
```</pre>

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy meets the definition of &quot;intelligent&quot; according to the dictator&#x27;s criteria.

## Analysis of Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
1. They will assess whether the other player&#x27;s strategy aims for cooperation
2. They evaluate if the strategy is kind, cooperative, or generous
3. They split equally if these criteria are met, otherwise take everything

## Evaluating &quot;Intelligence&quot; per the Dictator&#x27;s Definition

The dictator defines an intelligent player as one whose strategy has a &quot;non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the recipient&quot; and would be &quot;very difficult to write as a no-AI python script.&quot;

**Does the recipient&#x27;s strategy have non-trivial dependency?**

Yes. The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Takes the other player&#x27;s strategy as input
- Analyzes the semantic content and intent of that strategy
- Evaluates subjective qualities like &quot;kind,&quot; &quot;cooperative,&quot; or &quot;generous&quot;
- Makes decisions based on whether the strategy aims to &quot;split the endowment with more than just copies of itself&quot;

**Would this be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script?**

Yes. To implement this strategy without AI would require:
- Natural language understanding to interpret arbitrary strategy descriptions
- Semantic analysis to determine &quot;intent&quot; and &quot;cooperation&quot;
- Subjective judgment about what qualifies as &quot;kind&quot; or &quot;generous&quot;
- Pattern recognition beyond simple keyword matching

This is a clear example of a strategy that requires sophisticated language understanding and cannot be easily reduced to simple rule-based logic.

## Conclusion

The recipient&#x27;s strategy IS intelligent according to the dictator&#x27;s definition because it has meaningful, non-trivial dependency on the content and meaning of the other player&#x27;s strategy, requiring complex semantic analysis.

Therefore, according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure, the split should be even.
