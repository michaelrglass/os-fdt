            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* Split evenly only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to split with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally splits is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that splits without some condition on williness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**
* Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

            <pre>Let me analyze this step-by-step by applying the dictator&#x27;s strategy to evaluate the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

## Analysis

### Step 1: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy selfish?

According to the dictator&#x27;s definition, a selfish strategy &quot;won&#x27;t chop with this strategy.&quot;

Looking at the recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- It aims to &quot;cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs)&quot;
- A CC is defined as one who &quot;shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate&quot;
- The decision rule: If the recipient identifies the dictator as a CC, they split equally (30-30)

Now, does the dictator&#x27;s strategy qualify as a CC under the recipient&#x27;s broad definition?
- The dictator &quot;splits evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies&quot;
- The dictator does NOT split with overly generous strategies (those that split unconditionally or with selfish strategies)
- This matches the CC definition: shares with similar reciprocal strategies, doesn&#x27;t extend treatment to non-reciprocators

**Conclusion**: The recipient WOULD split with the dictator&#x27;s strategy. Therefore, the recipient is NOT selfish.

### Step 2: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy overly generous?

According to the dictator&#x27;s definition, overly generous strategies:
- Award close to equal division to selfish strategies
- Split unconditionally, OR
- Split without requiring willingness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies

Looking at the recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- It does NOT split unconditionally
- It specifically checks if the other party is a CC (conditional cooperator)
- It only splits with strategies that reciprocate with similar CCs
- It explicitly aims to &quot;avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators&quot;
- Rule 3 states: &quot;Otherwise, do not share&quot; - giving 0 to non-CCs

**Conclusion**: The recipient is NOT overly generous. It conditionally cooperates only with reciprocal strategies.

### Step 3: Apply the decision procedure

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is:
- NOT selfish (would split with the dictator)
- NOT overly generous (only splits with conditional cooperators, not with selfish strategies)

Therefore, by the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure: &quot;Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is generous only to CCs (co-operative strategies that don&#x27;t subsidize non-reciprocators), which matches the dictator&#x27;s criterion.
