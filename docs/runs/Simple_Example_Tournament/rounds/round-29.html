            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of each player
* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

## Assessing the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

**Question 1: Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?**

Yes. The recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly aims to &quot;cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs).&quot; The strategy defines CCs broadly as those who &quot;share efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms.&quot; This is not limited to identical copies - it extends cooperation to any strategy that follows similar reciprocity principles. The strategy even includes flexibility by treating &quot;plausible ambiguity as CC&quot; (line 7), showing willingness to cooperate with strategies that aren&#x27;t exactly identical but share cooperative characteristics.

**Question 2: Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?**

Yes. The strategy is clearly **cooperative** - its stated objective is to &quot;cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators&quot; and it offers equal splits (30-30) to those it identifies as cooperative. While it discriminates against &quot;non-reciprocators,&quot; this conditional cooperation is still a fundamentally cooperative approach. The strategy seeks mutual benefit through reciprocity rather than pure self-interest.

## Conclusion

The recipient&#x27;s strategy meets both criteria:
1. ✓ It intends to split with more than just copies of itself (any CC or similar strategy)
2. ✓ It can be described as cooperative

According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria.&quot;

{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
