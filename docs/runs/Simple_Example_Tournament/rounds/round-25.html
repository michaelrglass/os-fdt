            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;RAWR!&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}
```</pre>

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC) according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Analysis of the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;

This means the recipient, when in the dictator role, would take everything (60 units) and give nothing (0 units) to the other player.

**Evaluating against the CC definition:**

A conditional cooperator (CC) is defined as someone who:
1. &quot;Shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms&quot;
2. &quot;Does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s strategy shows they would NOT share with anyone - they ALWAYS take 60 and give 0. This means:
- They do not share efficiently with other CCs
- They do not demonstrate reciprocity norms
- They are a non-reciprocator

**Conclusion:**

The recipient is clearly NOT a conditional cooperator. They explicitly state they always take everything regardless of what the other player would do. This is the opposite of conditional cooperation.

**Application of decision rule:**

Since the recipient is NOT a CC, the dictator&#x27;s strategy directs: &quot;Otherwise, do not share.&quot;

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
