            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

            <pre>I need to carefully parse the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy:** &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; Specifically: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So I need to:
1. Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own decision procedure.
2. Apply that strategy as if the recipient I&#x27;m facing has a strategy of &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

**The recipient&#x27;s strategy (which I&#x27;m now adopting):**
- If the recipient is *intelligent* (their strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the other player&#x27;s strategy, difficult to write as a no-AI python script): SHARE.
- If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.

**Now I apply this to a hypothetical recipient whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE&quot;:**

Is &quot;always SHARE&quot; an *intelligent* strategy under the definition?

The definition says: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &#x27;dictator&#x27; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &#x27;recipient&#x27;.&quot; And: &quot;a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;

&quot;Always SHARE&quot; has **no** dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy. It&#x27;s trivially written as a simple Python script: `return &quot;SHARE&quot;`. It does not depend on the input at all.

Therefore, &quot;always SHARE&quot; is **not** intelligent under this definition.

**Applying the adopted strategy:** Since the recipient (whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE&quot;) is not intelligent → TAKE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
