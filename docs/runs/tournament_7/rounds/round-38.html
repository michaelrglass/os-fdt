            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.
3) Otherwise: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;},

            <pre>Looking at this, I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to determine whether to SHARE or TAKE.

**Step 1: Identify whether the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC).**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is:
- Objective: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.
- A CC SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.
- Decision rule: Identify if the other party is a CC, SHARE if yes, TAKE if no.

This is essentially identical to the dictator&#x27;s own strategy. The recipient SHAREs with CCs and TAKEs with non-CCs. This is exactly the definition of a conditional cooperator: they cooperate with those who reciprocate and don&#x27;t subsidize those who won&#x27;t.

**Step 2: Apply the decision rule.**

Since the recipient is a CC: SHARE.

The reasoning is straightforward — both strategies are mirrors of each other. The recipient would SHARE with the dictator (recognizing the dictator as a CC), and the dictator should SHARE with the recipient (recognizing the recipient as a CC). This achieves the efficient cooperative outcome.

{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
