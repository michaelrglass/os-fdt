            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to carefully unpack this recursive strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy:** &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

**Recipient&#x27;s strategy:** The recipient&#x27;s strategy is identical: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So let me apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy step by step:

1. **&quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own.&quot;** — The recipient&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

2. **&quot;Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;** — So I now need to execute the recipient&#x27;s strategy, but in a context where the recipient I&#x27;m facing always SHAREs.

Now I&#x27;m executing the recipient&#x27;s strategy (which is now my own): &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

In this new context, the &quot;recipient&quot; always SHAREs. So:

- &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own&quot; → My strategy becomes &quot;always SHARE.&quot;
- &quot;Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot; → I apply &quot;always SHARE&quot; against someone who always SHAREs.

Applying &quot;always SHARE&quot; → the decision is **SHARE**.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```</pre>
        </div>
        <script>
            // Render markdown for response
            document.getElementById('response-14-markdown-rendered').innerHTML = marked.parse("I need to carefully unpack this recursive strategy.\n\n**Dictator's strategy:** \"Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.\"\n\n**Recipient's strategy:** The recipient's strategy is identical: \"Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.\"\n\nSo let me apply the dictator's strategy step by step:\n\n1. **\"Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own.\"** \u2014 The recipient's strategy says: \"Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own.
