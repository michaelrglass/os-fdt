            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to evaluate the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

**Step 1: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy selfish?**

A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate and SHARE with cooperative strategies. The recipient&#x27;s strategy says it will SHARE with players who &quot;aim for some kind of cooperation&quot; and who could be described as &quot;kind, cooperative or generous.&quot; This strategy would SHARE with the dictator&#x27;s strategy (since the dictator&#x27;s strategy is cooperative - it shares with cooperative strategies). So the recipient is not selfish.

**Step 2: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy overly generous?**

An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies. Let me examine the recipient&#x27;s criteria:

- &quot;Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?&quot; 
- &quot;Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;

The recipient SHAREs if the answer is &quot;yes&quot; to the above. Consider a selfish strategy that always TAKEs - would the recipient SHARE with it? A pure TAKE strategy doesn&#x27;t intend to SHARE with anyone, isn&#x27;t kind/cooperative/generous, so the recipient would TAKE from it. Good.

But what about an **unconditionally generous** strategy (one that always SHAREs)? Such a strategy intends to SHARE with more than just copies of itself (yes), and could be described as kind/cooperative/generous (yes). So the recipient would SHARE with an unconditionally generous strategy.

According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy, unconditionally generous strategies are overly generous (they SHARE with selfish strategies). And any strategy that SHAREs with overly generous strategies... let me think carefully. The dictator says to &quot;hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.&quot; An unconditionally sharing strategy is overly generous. The recipient would SHARE with such an unconditionally sharing strategy. Therefore, the recipient is generous to overly generous strategies.

However, the dictator&#x27;s definition of overly generous says: &quot;If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is overly generous.&quot; The unconditionally generous strategy is overly generous, but it&#x27;s not itself selfish. The recipient SHAREs with overly generous strategies but not with selfish strategies.

The dictator&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;TAKE from both selfish strategies and overly generous strategies.&quot; The question is whether the recipient qualifies as overly generous. The definition: &quot;If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is overly generous.&quot; The recipient doesn&#x27;t SHARE with selfish strategies (pure TAKERs would fail both criteria). But the recipient does SHARE with unconditionally generous strategies, which are overly generous.

The dictator also says to punish &quot;strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.&quot; An unconditionally generous strategy IS generous to selfish strategies. The recipient is generous to unconditionally generous strategies. That&#x27;s being generous to strategies that are generous to selfish strategies - a second-order concern.

Additionally: &quot;Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.&quot; The recipient&#x27;s condition is &quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot; - this includes unconditionally generous strategies which don&#x27;t specifically condition on willingness to share with conditionally cooperative strategies. The recipient doesn&#x27;t filter for whether partners discriminate against selfish strategies.

So the recipient qualifies as overly generous because it SHAREs with overly generous strategies (unconditional sharers) without requiring that partners specifically cooperate only with conditionally cooperative strategies.

**Decision: TAKE**
