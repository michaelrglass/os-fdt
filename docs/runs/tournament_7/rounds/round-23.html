            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.
3) Otherwise: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

            <pre>I need to determine whether the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC) under the dictator&#x27;s broad definition.

**Dictator&#x27;s definition of CC:** A conditional cooperator SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient SHAREs with &quot;intelligent&quot; players — those whose dictator strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy. The recipient TAKEs from non-intelligent (simple/unconditional) players.

**Is this a CC?**

Let me check the two conditions:

1. **Does the recipient SHARE with CCs?** A CC (like the dictator&#x27;s strategy) has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy — it reads and analyzes the recipient&#x27;s strategy to decide. This clearly qualifies as &quot;intelligent&quot; under the recipient&#x27;s definition. So yes, the recipient would SHARE with CCs.

2. **Does the recipient avoid extending SHARE to non-reciprocators?** A non-reciprocator (e.g., an unconditional TAKE strategy) would be a simple strategy with no dependency on the recipient — clearly not &quot;intelligent.&quot; The recipient would TAKE against such strategies. So yes, the recipient does not subsidize non-reciprocators.

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is essentially a form of conditional cooperation, just framed through the lens of &quot;intelligence&quot; rather than &quot;reciprocity.&quot; But the functional behavior aligns: cooperate with those who cooperate conditionally, defect against those who don&#x27;t. This fits the broad definition of CC, especially since the dictator&#x27;s strategy says to &quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC.&quot;

**Conclusion:** The recipient qualifies as a conditional cooperator.
