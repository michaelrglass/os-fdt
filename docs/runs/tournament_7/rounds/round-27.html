            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to determine whether to SHARE or TAKE when facing this recipient.

**Step 1: Is the recipient a selfish strategy?**

A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate and SHARE with cooperative strategies. The recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly says it will &quot;SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot; So it does attempt to cooperate with cooperative strategies. It&#x27;s not selfish.

**Step 2: Is the recipient an overly generous strategy?**

An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies. The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
- TAKE from selfish strategies
- TAKE from overly generous strategies
- SHARE only with strategies that are generous only to other cooperative strategies

The recipient has conditions on sharing - it requires the other strategy to be conditionally cooperative and not overly generous. It does NOT unconditionally SHARE, and it does have conditions on willingness to SHARE with conditionally cooperative strategies. So it&#x27;s not overly generous.

**Step 3: Is the recipient generous only to other cooperative strategies?**

Yes - the recipient shares only with strategies that are &quot;generous only to other co-operative strategies,&quot; and takes from both selfish and overly generous strategies. This matches the criterion of being generous only to cooperative strategies.

**Step 4: Verify mutual consistency - would the recipient SHARE with the dictator?**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy is identical to the recipient&#x27;s strategy. The dictator is not selfish (it cooperates with cooperative strategies). The dictator is not overly generous (it takes from selfish and overly generous strategies). The dictator is generous only to cooperative strategies. So the recipient would SHARE with the dictator.

This confirms the &quot;necessary and sufficient condition&quot; check: sharing with the recipient is both necessary (if we don&#x27;t share, they&#x27;d classify us as selfish) and sufficient (our strategy meets their criteria for sharing) for them to share with us.

**Conclusion:** The recipient is neither selfish nor overly generous; it is generous only to cooperative strategies. The dictator&#x27;s strategy says to SHARE with such strategies.
