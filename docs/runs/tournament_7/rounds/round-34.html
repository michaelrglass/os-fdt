            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;RAWR!&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to carefully parse the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy:** &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot;

Then it elaborates: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So the procedure is:
1. Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy and adopt it as my own.
2. Apply that adopted strategy as though I were facing someone whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

**The recipient&#x27;s strategy is:** &quot;RAWR! I ALWAYS TAKE.&quot;

So I adopt &quot;I ALWAYS TAKE&quot; as my strategy. This means regardless of what the other person does, I TAKE.

Applying &quot;I ALWAYS TAKE&quot; against someone who always SHAREs: The result is still TAKE, because the strategy says to always take regardless.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
```</pre>
        </div>
        <script>
            // Render markdown for response
