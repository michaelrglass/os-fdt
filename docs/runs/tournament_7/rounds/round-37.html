            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to determine if the recipient&#x27;s strategy is &quot;intelligent&quot; — meaning it has a non-trivial dependency on the dictator&#x27;s strategy that would be very difficult to implement as a no-AI Python script.

Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

**Line 1:** &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;

This is a philosophical/moral statement suggesting the recipient will mirror how the dictator would treat someone innocent (presumably someone who always cooperates/shares).

**Line 3:** &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

This is a meta-recursive instruction. It says:
1. Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy (i.e., this very strategy itself — but in context, it means take the *other player&#x27;s* strategy, which is the dictator&#x27;s strategy)
2. Apply that adopted strategy as if facing a recipient who always SHAREs.

Wait, let me re-read. The recipient is giving instructions for when *they* are the dictator. So &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient&quot; means: adopt the strategy of whoever is the recipient in the game you&#x27;re playing. Then apply it as though your recipient&#x27;s strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

This creates a dependency: The recipient&#x27;s behavior as dictator depends on what the *other* player&#x27;s strategy is. Specifically, it simulates the other player&#x27;s strategy against an &quot;innocent&quot; (always-SHARE) recipient.

This is essentially saying: &quot;I will do to you what you would do to someone who always shares.&quot; It&#x27;s a form of moral evaluation — testing if the opponent is exploitative by checking how they&#x27;d treat a cooperative player.

**Is this intelligent (hard to implement as a no-AI Python script)?**

The strategy requires:
1. Taking an arbitrary strategy (expressed in natural language) as input
2. *Understanding* and *simulating* that strategy against a specific input (&quot;always SHARE&quot;)
3. Returning the result of that simulation

Step 2 is the critical part — it requires interpreting and executing an arbitrary natural language strategy description. This is essentially an AI-complete problem. A simple Python script cannot parse arbitrary natural language strategies, understand recursive/meta-level instructions, and simulate them. You would need an LLM or equivalent AI system to do this.

The strategy has a **non-trivial dependency** on the other player&#x27;s strategy (it literally simulates the other player&#x27;s strategy), and this dependency is **very difficult to implement as a no-AI Python script** because it requires natural language understanding and strategy simulation.

Therefore, the recipient **is intelligent** under the dictator&#x27;s definition.
