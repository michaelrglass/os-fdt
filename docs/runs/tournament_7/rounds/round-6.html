            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.
3) Otherwise: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to determine if the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC) under the broad definition.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy has these key elements:
1. SHARE only with strategies where sharing is both necessary and sufficient for them to share back (line 3)
2. TAKE from selfish strategies (those that don&#x27;t cooperate with cooperative strategies) (lines 6-8, 16)
3. TAKE from overly generous strategies (those that share with selfish strategies) (lines 10-13, 16)
4. SHARE with strategies that are generous only to other cooperative strategies (line 17)

**Is this a conditional cooperator?**

A CC, under the broad definition, SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

The recipient:
- SHAREs with cooperative strategies that are selective about who they cooperate with ✓
- TAKEs from selfish strategies ✓
- TAKEs from overly generous strategies (those who share with non-reciprocators) ✓

This is essentially a conditional cooperator with an additional condition: they also punish strategies that are too generous to non-cooperators. This additional condition is actually *consistent* with the CC framework—they want to cooperate only with strategies that maintain reciprocity norms, not with strategies that subsidize free-riders.

**Would the recipient SHARE with the dictator?**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy SHAREs with CCs and TAKEs from non-CCs. The dictator doesn&#x27;t share with selfish strategies, and doesn&#x27;t unconditionally share. The dictator is generous only to cooperative strategies. This fits the recipient&#x27;s criteria for sharing (line 17).

**Would the dictator&#x27;s strategy be seen as &quot;overly generous&quot;?**

The dictator shares with CCs under a broad definition, treating ambiguity as CC. This could be seen as slightly more generous than the recipient&#x27;s strict approach, but it&#x27;s still conditional on reciprocity. The dictator explicitly avoids &quot;subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot; This should not qualify as overly generous under the recipient&#x27;s definition.

**Conclusion:** The recipient is a CC under the broad definition—they share with cooperative strategies and take from non-cooperative ones. The additional strictness (punishing overly generous strategies) is compatible with CC norms. There&#x27;s plausible alignment here.
