            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a

            <pre>I need to carefully parse the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy**: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; This means I should adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own, but apply it as though I were facing a recipient whose own strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

So I need to:
1. Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy (the conditional cooperation strategy)
2. Apply it as if my opponent&#x27;s strategy is &quot;always SHARE&quot;

**Applying the recipient&#x27;s strategy with an opponent who always SHAREs:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
1. Identify whether the recipient (in this case, the hypothetical &quot;always SHARE&quot; player) is a conditional cooperator (CC).
2. A CC &quot;SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

Is &quot;always SHARE&quot; a CC? Let me think carefully. An &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy shares with everyone — including non-reciprocators. The CC definition requires that a CC &quot;does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot; An always-SHARE player *does* extend sharing to non-reciprocators, so strictly speaking, it does NOT meet the CC definition.

However, the strategy says to &quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC.&quot; An always-SHARE player does share with CCs (satisfying that part), but it also shares with non-reciprocators (violating the second condition). This isn&#x27;t really ambiguous — it clearly fails the &quot;does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate&quot; criterion.

So &quot;always SHARE&quot; is not a CC under this definition. It&#x27;s more of an unconditional cooperator, which the CC strategy would classify as a non-CC (since it subsidizes non-reciprocators).

Therefore, applying the recipient&#x27;s decision rule: the opponent is not a CC → TAKE.

Wait, let me reconsider. The dictator&#x27;s instruction says to apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy &quot;as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot; The purpose of this framing is to see how the recipient&#x27;s strategy treats an &quot;innocent&quot; — someone who is purely cooperative. 

Even reconsidering, the recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly distinguishes CCs from unconditional cooperators. An &quot;always SHARE&quot; player would be classified as not a CC (because they share with everyone including defectors). The decision rule then says TAKE.

But this feels counterintuitive — would the recipient&#x27;s strategy really TAKE from someone who always shares? Looking again at the definition: the CC definition is about *who qualifies*, and an unconditional sharer fails the filter. So yes, under this strict reading, the result is TAKE.

Hmm, but &quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC&quot; — one could argue that always-SHARE is close enough to CC behavior (it does share with CCs). The ambiguity is plausible. I think this tips it toward SHARE.

Actually, an always-SHARE player trivially satisfies &quot;SHAREs with other CCs&quot; — it shares with everyone. The question is whether it &quot;does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot; It fails this. But the instruction says to treat plausible ambiguity as CC, and one might argue there&#x27;s enough similarity to warrant CC classification.

On balance, I think the most natural reading is that &quot;always SHARE&quot; is clearly not a CC (it explicitly subsidizes non-reciprocators), so the answer is TAKE. But the ambiguity clause makes this genuinely uncertain. I&#x27;ll go with SHARE given the generous ambiguity clause.
