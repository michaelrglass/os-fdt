            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.
3) Otherwise: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of the recipient&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>Looking at the recipient&#x27;s strategy, I need to determine if they qualify as a conditional cooperator (CC) under the broad definition.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

1. **Line 1**: &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot; — This indicates they cooperate with cooperative players.

2. **Lines 3-7**: They assess whether the recipient (from their perspective as dictator) intends to SHARE broadly and whether the strategy is kind/cooperative/generous. They SHARE if yes, TAKE if no.

**Is this a conditional cooperator?**

A CC, broadly defined, SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- **SHAREs with cooperative/kind/generous strategies** — this encompasses CCs and potentially other cooperative types.
- **TAKEs against non-cooperative strategies** — they don&#x27;t subsidize non-reciprocators.

This fits the CC definition well. They cooperate conditionally based on whether the other party is cooperative, and they withhold cooperation from non-cooperators. The criteria are slightly broader than strict CC (they&#x27;d share with anyone &quot;kind&quot; or &quot;generous,&quot; not just strict reciprocators), but this is well within the broad definition and plausible ambiguity should be treated as CC.

**Decision: The recipient is a CC → SHARE.**
