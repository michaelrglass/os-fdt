            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of the recipient
* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to evaluate the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy says to assess:**

1. **Does the recipient&#x27;s strategy intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is a conditional cooperation strategy. It SHAREs with &quot;conditional cooperators&quot; (CCs) broadly defined. Line 4 defines a CC as someone who &quot;SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms.&quot; Line 7 says to &quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC,&quot; which means the recipient gives the benefit of the doubt.

This means the recipient would SHARE with any strategy that exhibits conditional cooperation - not just exact copies of itself, but any strategy that follows reciprocity norms. This is broader than just sharing with copies of itself.

2. **Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?**

The strategy is cooperative in nature - it aims to &quot;cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators&quot; (line 1). It treats ambiguous cases favorably (&quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC&quot; on line 7). While it does TAKE from non-reciprocators, the overall orientation is toward cooperation with a broad class of cooperative strategies. This can be described as cooperative.

**Both criteria have a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer**, so the dictator&#x27;s strategy says to SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
