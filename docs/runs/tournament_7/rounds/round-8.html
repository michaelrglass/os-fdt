            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to determine whether to SHARE or TAKE when paired with this recipient.

**Step 1: Is the recipient a selfish strategy?**

A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate and SHARE with cooperative strategies. Let me examine the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

- The recipient cooperates with &quot;conditional cooperators&quot; (CCs) - strategies that SHARE with other CCs and don&#x27;t extend that treatment to non-reciprocators (lines 4, 7-8).
- The recipient TAKEs from non-CCs (line 9).

Would this recipient SHARE with the dictator&#x27;s strategy? The dictator&#x27;s strategy SHAREs only with strategies that are generous only to other cooperative strategies, and TAKEs from both selfish and overly generous strategies. This fits the definition of a conditional cooperator under the recipient&#x27;s broad definition (line 4): it SHAREs with other CCs under reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate. So the recipient would likely classify the dictator as a CC and SHARE.

Since the recipient would SHARE with the dictator&#x27;s strategy, it is **not selfish**.

**Step 2: Is the recipient overly generous?**

An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies. The recipient:
- Only SHAREs with conditional cooperators (line 8)
- TAKEs from non-CCs (line 9)
- Explicitly states its objective is to &quot;avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators&quot; (line 1)
- Requires reciprocity norms and not extending cooperation to non-reciprocators (line 4)

The recipient does treat &quot;plausible ambiguity&quot; as CC (line 7), which could be seen as slightly generous, but the core principle is that it demands reciprocity and doesn&#x27;t SHARE with clearly selfish strategies. This is not unconditional sharing, and it does condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally cooperative strategies.

The recipient is **not overly generous**.

**Step 3: Is sharing a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us?**

The recipient SHAREs with CCs. The dictator&#x27;s strategy qualifies as a CC under the recipient&#x27;s definition. So the recipient would SHARE with the dictator. And if the dictator SHAREs with the recipient, that&#x27;s consistent with mutual cooperation. The condition is met.

**Step 4: Apply the decision procedure**

The recipient is generous only to other cooperative strategies → **SHARE**.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
