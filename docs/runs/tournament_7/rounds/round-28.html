            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.

            <pre>I need to follow the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So I need to take the recipient&#x27;s strategy and apply it to evaluate a hypothetical recipient whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

Let me walk through the recipient&#x27;s decision procedure:

**Step 1: Is &quot;always SHARE&quot; a selfish strategy?**
- Selfish strategies don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
- &quot;Always SHARE&quot; does SHARE with co-operative strategies (it SHAREs with everyone).
- So &quot;always SHARE&quot; is NOT a selfish strategy.

**Step 2: Is &quot;always SHARE&quot; an overly generous strategy?**
- A strategy is overly generous if it SHAREs with selfish strategies.
- &quot;Always SHARE&quot; unconditionally SHAREs — it SHAREs with selfish strategies too.
- Line 12 explicitly states: &quot;Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.&quot;
- So &quot;always SHARE&quot; IS an overly generous strategy.

**Step 3: Apply the decision procedure:**
- Line 16: &quot;TAKE from both selfish strategies and overly generous strategies.&quot;
- Since &quot;always SHARE&quot; is overly generous, the decision is TAKE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
```</pre>
