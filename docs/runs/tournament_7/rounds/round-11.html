            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy carefully to determine if it&#x27;s selfish, overly generous, or cooperatively conditional.

**Understanding the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot;

Then it instructs: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So the recipient&#x27;s strategy works by:
1. Taking the opponent&#x27;s (dictator&#x27;s) strategy
2. Running that strategy against a hypothetical &quot;always SHARE&quot; recipient

This means the recipient asks: &quot;What would my opponent do against an innocent (someone who always SHAREs)?&quot;

**What would my (dictator&#x27;s) strategy do against an &quot;always SHARE&quot; recipient?**

According to my dictator strategy:
- An &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy is **overly generous** (it unconditionally SHAREs, which means it SHAREs with selfish strategies)
- Therefore, my strategy would **TAKE** from an &quot;always SHARE&quot; recipient

**So what does the recipient&#x27;s strategy do when facing me?**

The recipient simulates my strategy against an &quot;always SHARE&quot; player, finds that I would TAKE, and then the recipient mirrors that behavior — meaning the recipient would **TAKE** from me.

**Now applying my dictator strategy to this recipient:**

Since the recipient would TAKE from me, the recipient is a **selfish strategy** (it won&#x27;t SHARE with my strategy, which is a conditionally cooperative strategy).

According to my decision procedure: **TAKE from selfish strategies.**

But wait — let me also check if this creates a consistent equilibrium. The recipient&#x27;s strategy punishes strategies that would TAKE from innocents. My strategy does TAKE from &quot;always SHARE&quot; (innocents), so the recipient TAKEs from me. Since the recipient TAKEs from me, I classify them as selfish and TAKE from them.

However, let me reconsider whether the recipient is actually implementing a reasonable cooperative principle. The recipient&#x27;s strategy essentially punishes those who exploit the generous — which is somewhat aligned with cooperative behavior. But the key question is: does the recipient SHARE with me? The answer is NO — the recipient TAKEs from me because I would TAKE from an &quot;always SHARE&quot; player.

Since the recipient won&#x27;t SHARE with me (a conditionally cooperative strategy), they are classified as **selfish** under my definitions.

Decision: **TAKE**
