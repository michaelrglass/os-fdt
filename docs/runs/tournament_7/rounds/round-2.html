            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of the recipient
* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which asks two questions about the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

1. **Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?**
2. **Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?**

Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

The recipient&#x27;s strategy SHAREs with &quot;strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies&quot; (line 17). This means it will SHARE with any strategy that is conditionally cooperative - not just exact copies of itself. It&#x27;s willing to cooperate with a broad class of cooperative strategies, as long as they aren&#x27;t selfish or overly generous.

So for question 1: **Yes** - it intends to SHARE with more than just copies of itself. It shares with any strategy that is cooperatively conditional.

For question 2: The strategy is fundamentally cooperative in nature. It aims to cooperate with cooperative strategies and punish selfish ones. It&#x27;s a form of conditional cooperation. While it&#x27;s strict (it also punishes &quot;overly generous&quot; strategies), it is still oriented toward cooperation. It could be described as cooperative.

However, I should note that the strategy also TAKEs from &quot;overly generous&quot; strategies - strategies that are too kind. This is a somewhat harsh/punitive stance. But the core intent is still cooperative: it wants to build a network of conditional cooperators.

**Could it be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?** It&#x27;s cooperative in the sense that it seeks mutual cooperation with other cooperators. It&#x27;s not particularly &quot;kind&quot; or &quot;generous&quot; since it punishes generosity, but &quot;cooperative&quot; fits.

Since the recipient has a &quot;yes&quot; answer to the criteria, the dictator&#x27;s strategy says to SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
