            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of the recipient
* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of the recipient&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to evaluate the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy:** SHARE if the recipient&#x27;s strategy answers &#x27;yes&#x27; to:
1. Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?
2. Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is identical to the dictator&#x27;s strategy. It says: &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot; It then assesses whether the other player intends to SHARE with more than just copies of itself and whether the strategy could be described as kind, cooperative, or generous.

**Question 1: Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?**

Yes. The recipient&#x27;s strategy SHAREs with anyone who &quot;aims for some kind of cooperation&quot; — this is a broad criterion that encompasses many different strategies, not just copies of itself. Any strategy that is cooperative or generous would qualify.

**Question 2: Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?**

Yes. The strategy is designed to cooperate with cooperative players. It aims to reward cooperation, which is itself a cooperative and kind approach.

Since both criteria receive a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer, the dictator should SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
