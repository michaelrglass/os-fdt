            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to determine whether to SHARE or TAKE when facing this recipient strategy.

**Step 1: Is the recipient strategy selfish?**

A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate and SHARE with cooperative strategies. Let me examine the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

- The recipient cooperates with &quot;conditional cooperators&quot; (CCs) - strategies that SHARE with other CCs under reciprocity norms and don&#x27;t extend that treatment to non-reciprocators.
- The recipient SHAREs with CCs and TAKEs from non-CCs.

This is clearly a cooperative strategy that attempts to SHARE with cooperative partners. It&#x27;s not selfish.

**Step 2: Is the recipient strategy overly generous?**

An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies or unconditionally SHAREs. Let me check:

- The recipient explicitly only SHAREs with conditional cooperators (line 8).
- It TAKEs from non-CCs (line 9).
- It has a condition on willingness to reciprocate - it checks whether the other strategy is a CC that &quot;does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate&quot; (line 4).

This strategy does NOT unconditionally SHARE. It conditions sharing on the other party being a conditional cooperator. It also requires that CCs don&#x27;t extend cooperation to non-reciprocators. This means it won&#x27;t SHARE with overly generous strategies (since those would share with non-reciprocators, failing the CC definition).

So the recipient is NOT overly generous.

**Step 3: Would the recipient SHARE with the dictator&#x27;s strategy?**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy SHAREs with cooperative strategies and TAKEs from selfish and overly generous strategies. This fits the definition of a CC - it shares with other CCs under reciprocity norms and doesn&#x27;t extend cooperation to non-reciprocators. So the recipient would likely classify the dictator as a CC and SHARE.

**Step 4: Is sharing a necessary and sufficient condition?**

The recipient shares with us because we&#x27;re a CC. If we were selfish, they&#x27;d TAKE. So our cooperative nature is necessary for them to SHARE. And being a CC is sufficient for them to SHARE. This satisfies the &quot;necessary and sufficient&quot; condition.

**Step 5: Final classification**

The recipient is generous only to other cooperative strategies → SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
