            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
```

            <pre>I need to determine if the recipient is &quot;intelligent&quot; according to the dictator&#x27;s definition.

**Definition of intelligent**: A player whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;, and would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy (when acting as dictator) is:
1. Identify whether the recipient is a &quot;conditional cooperator&quot; (CC) under a broad definition
2. If CC: SHARE
3. Otherwise: TAKE

The key question is: Does this strategy have a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy, and would it be very difficult to implement as a no-AI python script?

The recipient&#x27;s strategy requires:
- Reading and **understanding** the other player&#x27;s strategy text
- Determining whether that strategy constitutes a &quot;conditional cooperator&quot; — someone who SHAREs with other CCs and doesn&#x27;t extend that treatment to non-reciprocators
- Handling &quot;plausible ambiguity&quot; generously

This is essentially a **natural language understanding and semantic reasoning** task. To classify whether an arbitrary strategy text describes a &quot;conditional cooperator,&quot; you would need to:
- Parse natural language strategies of arbitrary complexity
- Understand the semantic meaning of those strategies
- Evaluate whether the described behavior matches the CC pattern
- Handle paraphrases, synonyms, and ambiguous cases

This would be **very difficult** to implement as a no-AI python script. Simple keyword matching or regex wouldn&#x27;t reliably handle the diversity of possible strategy descriptions. It fundamentally requires language understanding and reasoning about the meaning of strategies — tasks that essentially require AI/LLM capabilities.

Therefore, the recipient **is intelligent** under the dictator&#x27;s definition, because their strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy and would be very difficult to implement without AI.
