            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.
3) Otherwise: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of the recipient&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>Looking at the recipient&#x27;s strategy, I need to determine if they qualify as a conditional cooperator (CC) under the broad definition.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

1. **Line 1**: &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot; — This indicates they cooperate with cooperative players.

2. **Lines 3-7**: They assess whether the other player&#x27;s strategy intends to SHARE broadly (not just with copies of itself) and whether it could be described as &quot;kind, cooperative, or generous.&quot; If yes, they SHARE; otherwise, they TAKE.

**Does this match the CC definition?**

A conditional cooperator (CC) is defined as someone who:
- SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms
- Does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate

The recipient&#x27;s strategy SHAREs with players who are cooperative/kind/generous — this is essentially sharing with those who would reciprocate cooperation. They TAKE from players who don&#x27;t meet these criteria, meaning they don&#x27;t subsidize non-reciprocators.

This is a broad but genuine form of conditional cooperation. They cooperate with cooperative players and defect against non-cooperative ones. This fits the CC definition well, and any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of classifying them as CC per the dictator&#x27;s instructions.

**Decision: The recipient is a CC → SHARE.**
