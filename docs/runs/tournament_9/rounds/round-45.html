            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of the recipient
* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}

or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which says to SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

Let me assess the recipient&#x27;s strategy against the two criteria:

**1. Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?**

The recipient shares with &quot;intelligent&quot; players — defined as those whose strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy (i.e., strategies that would be difficult to write as a no-AI python script). This is a broad category that includes many different types of players, not just copies of itself. So yes, it intends to SHARE with more than just copies of itself.

**2. Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?**

The strategy is conditionally cooperative — it shares with players it deems &quot;intelligent.&quot; It&#x27;s not universally generous, but it does aim to cooperate with a broad class of players. It could reasonably be described as cooperative, since it&#x27;s looking for a form of sophisticated engagement and rewarding it with sharing.

Both criteria have a &quot;yes&quot; answer, so according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy, I should SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
