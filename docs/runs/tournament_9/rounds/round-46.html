            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which says to SHARE if the recipient is &quot;intelligent&quot; — meaning their strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy that would be very difficult to implement as a no-AI python script.

Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is essentially identical to the dictator&#x27;s strategy. It aims to SHARE with &quot;intelligent&quot; players, where &quot;intelligent&quot; is defined as having a strategy with a non-trivial dependency on the other player&#x27;s strategy — one that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script.

The key question: Does the recipient&#x27;s strategy have a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of their recipient (i.e., the other player)?

Yes, it does. The recipient&#x27;s strategy requires:
1. Reading and understanding the other player&#x27;s strategy text
2. Determining whether that strategy has a &quot;non-trivial dependency&quot; on the recipient&#x27;s strategy
3. Assessing whether the strategy &quot;would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script&quot;

This is essentially a semantic analysis task — understanding natural language strategies, evaluating their computational complexity, and making a judgment about whether AI-level reasoning is required to implement them. This would be extremely difficult (arguably impossible) to implement as a simple no-AI Python script, because it requires deep natural language understanding and reasoning about the nature of other strategies.

Therefore, the recipient **is** intelligent under the dictator&#x27;s definition.

According to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure: if the recipient is intelligent, SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
