            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.

            <pre>I need to carefully parse the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy**: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; This means I should adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own, and apply it as though I were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.

So I need to take the recipient&#x27;s strategy and apply it to evaluate a hypothetical opponent whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

**Applying the recipient&#x27;s strategy to an &quot;always SHARE&quot; opponent:**

First, let me check: Is &quot;always SHARE&quot; a **selfish strategy**?
- Selfish strategies &quot;don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.&quot; 
- &quot;Always SHARE&quot; does SHARE with co-operative strategies, so it is NOT selfish.

Next, is &quot;always SHARE&quot; an **overly generous strategy**?
- Line 11-13: &quot;If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is overly generous.&quot;
  - &quot;Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.&quot; (Line 12)
- &quot;Always SHARE&quot; unconditionally shares, so it IS overly generous.

**Decision Procedure** (Line 15-17):
- &quot;TAKE from both selfish strategies and overly generous strategies.&quot;
- &quot;Always SHARE&quot; is overly generous, so the decision is **TAKE**.

Therefore, applying the recipient&#x27;s strategy to an &quot;always SHARE&quot; opponent yields TAKE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
