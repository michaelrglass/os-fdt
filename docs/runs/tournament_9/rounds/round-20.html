            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy to determine if it&#x27;s selfish, overly generous, or cooperatively conditional.

**Understanding the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot;

Then it elaborates: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So the recipient&#x27;s strategy is: Take your opponent&#x27;s strategy, and simulate what it would do against an &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy (an &quot;innocent&quot;). Then do whatever that result is.

**What would the recipient do when facing MY (the dictator&#x27;s) strategy?**

The recipient takes my strategy and applies it against an &quot;always SHARE&quot; recipient.

So: What does my dictator strategy do against an &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy?

According to my strategy:
- An &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy is **overly generous** because it unconditionally SHAREs (it SHAREs with selfish strategies).
- My strategy says to TAKE from overly generous strategies.

So my strategy would TAKE from an &quot;always SHARE&quot; player.

Therefore, the recipient&#x27;s strategy would evaluate: &quot;The dictator would TAKE from an innocent (always SHARE). So I will TAKE from the dictator.&quot;

**Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy selfish?**

A selfish strategy is one that won&#x27;t SHARE with my strategy. Since the recipient would TAKE from me, yes — the recipient is effectively selfish toward me.

But wait — let me check if this is actually a conditionally cooperative strategy. Let me think about what happens if a genuinely cooperative strategy faces this recipient. If a cooperative strategy would SHARE with an always-SHARE player, then the recipient would SHARE with that cooperative strategy. So the recipient does discriminate — it&#x27;s not unconditionally selfish.

However, the key question for my decision procedure: **Will this strategy SHARE with my strategy?** No, because my strategy TAKEs from &quot;always SHARE&quot; (innocents), so the recipient will TAKE from me.

Per my strategy&#x27;s definitions: &quot;any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.&quot;

The recipient won&#x27;t SHARE with me → it&#x27;s a selfish strategy (from my perspective).

My decision procedure says: **TAKE from selfish strategies.**

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
