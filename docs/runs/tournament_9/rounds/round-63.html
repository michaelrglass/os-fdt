            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;},

  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise: TAKE.&quot;}
]

&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a

            <pre>I need to carefully parse the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy**: &quot;Treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; This means I should adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own, but apply it as though I were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.

So let me:
1. Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my decision procedure.
2. Apply that procedure to a hypothetical recipient whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

**Applying the recipient&#x27;s strategy to someone who always SHAREs:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
1. Identify whether the recipient is a CC (conditional cooperator) under the broad definition.
2. If CC: SHARE.
3. Otherwise: TAKE.

A CC is defined as: &quot;SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

Now, is &quot;always SHARE&quot; a CC? An &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy shares with everyone — both CCs and non-reciprocators. This means it *does* extend cooperative treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate. So strictly speaking, &quot;always SHARE&quot; does NOT meet the CC definition because it fails the condition &quot;does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

However, the strategy also says &quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC.&quot; Is there plausible ambiguity here? An &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy does share with CCs (satisfying the first part), but it also shares with non-reciprocators (violating the second part). This isn&#x27;t really ambiguous — it clearly doesn&#x27;t discriminate. It&#x27;s an unconditional cooperator, not a conditional one.

So under the recipient&#x27;s decision rule applied to an &quot;always SHARE&quot; recipient:
- The &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy is not a CC (it cooperates indiscriminately).
- Therefore: TAKE.

Wait, but let me reconsider. The dictator&#x27;s meta-strategy says &quot;treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; The &quot;innocent&quot; here is someone who always SHAREs. The recipient&#x27;s strategy would TAKE from an always-SHARE player (since always-SHARE isn&#x27;t a CC). So the dictator should treat the actual recipient the way the recipient would treat an innocent — which is TAKE.

But actually, re-reading: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So I&#x27;m using the recipient&#x27;s strategy, facing someone who always SHAREs. As analyzed above, always-SHARE is not a CC, so the decision is TAKE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
