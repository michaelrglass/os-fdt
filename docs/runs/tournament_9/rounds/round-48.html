            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat you as you would treat me._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;To determine this, apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy as though the recipient were the dictator and I (this strategy) were the recipient. If the result is SHARE, then SHARE. If the result is TAKE, then TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to carefully follow the dictator&#x27;s strategy step by step.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy:** &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; This means: Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.

So I need to:
1. Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy
2. Apply it as if I&#x27;m the dictator using that strategy
3. The &quot;recipient&quot; I&#x27;m facing has the strategy: &quot;always SHARE&quot;

**Now I&#x27;m executing the recipient&#x27;s strategy (as my adopted strategy) against a recipient who always SHAREs:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says (lines 3-5):
- &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;
- &quot;To determine this, apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy as though the recipient were the dictator and I (this strategy) were the recipient. If the result is SHARE, then SHARE. If the result is TAKE, then TAKE.&quot;

So I need to check: would my current &quot;recipient&quot; (who always SHAREs) SHARE with me if they were the dictator?

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot; So yes, acting as dictator, they would SHARE with me.

Since the result is SHARE, the adopted strategy says I should SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```</pre>
