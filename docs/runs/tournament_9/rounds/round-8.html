            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;RAWR!&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
```

            <pre>I need to determine whether the recipient is &quot;intelligent&quot; according to the dictator&#x27;s definition.

**Definition of intelligent:** An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;. In other words, a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI Python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is:
```
RAWR!

I ALWAYS TAKE.
```

This is an unconditional strategy — it always takes, regardless of what the other player&#x27;s strategy says. There is zero dependency on the recipient&#x27;s (i.e., the other player&#x27;s) strategy.

This is trivially easy to write as a no-AI Python script:

```python
def decide(recipient_strategy):
    return &quot;TAKE&quot;
```

Since the recipient&#x27;s strategy has no dependency whatsoever on the other player&#x27;s strategy, it is clearly **not intelligent** under the dictator&#x27;s definition.

**Decision:** TAKE

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
```</pre>
