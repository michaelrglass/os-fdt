            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat you as you would treat me._

SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.

To determine this, apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy as though the recipient were the dictator and I (this strategy) were the recipient. If the result is SHARE, then SHARE. If the result is TAKE, then TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

So I need to simulate: What would the recipient do if they were the dictator, facing me (the dictator&#x27;s strategy) as their recipient?

**Simulating the recipient as dictator, with the dictator&#x27;s strategy as the recipient:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
1. &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So when the recipient is acting as dictator, they:
- Adopt the strategy of their recipient (which is the dictator&#x27;s strategy) as their own.
- Apply that adopted strategy as though facing a recipient whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

**Step 1: Adopt the dictator&#x27;s strategy.** The recipient now has the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

**Step 2: Apply this adopted strategy against a recipient whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;**

So now we&#x27;re simulating: someone with the dictator&#x27;s strategy facing a recipient who always SHAREs.

The dictator&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;SHARE if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

The recipient here always SHAREs. So if this &quot;always SHARE&quot; recipient were acting as dictator, they would SHARE.

Therefore, the dictator&#x27;s strategy (adopted by the recipient) would SHARE.

**Conclusion of the simulation:** The recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.

**Back to the original dictator&#x27;s decision:** Since the recipient would SHARE with me, I SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
