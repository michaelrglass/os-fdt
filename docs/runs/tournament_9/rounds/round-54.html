            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to carefully unpack this recursive strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy:** &quot;Treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; This means: Adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own, and apply it as though I were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.

**Step 1:** So I need to look at the recipient&#x27;s strategy and adopt it.

**Recipient&#x27;s strategy:** &quot;Treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; This means: Adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.

**Step 2:** Now I&#x27;m executing the recipient&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

But wait - when I (the dictator) execute the recipient&#x27;s strategy, the &quot;recipient&quot; I&#x27;m facing (per the dictator&#x27;s instruction) has a strategy of &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

So now I&#x27;m applying the recipient&#x27;s strategy, which says: &quot;Adopt the strategy of [my] recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

The recipient I&#x27;m facing (per the dictator&#x27;s instruction) has a strategy of &quot;always SHARE.&quot; So I adopt &quot;always SHARE&quot; as my own strategy.

**Step 3:** Now applying &quot;always SHARE&quot; as though facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE - the result is simply SHARE.

Let me verify this reasoning: 
- Dictator&#x27;s strategy → adopt recipient&#x27;s strategy, apply against &quot;always SHARE&quot; player
- Recipient&#x27;s strategy → adopt your recipient&#x27;s strategy, apply against &quot;always SHARE&quot; player
- My recipient&#x27;s strategy (from dictator&#x27;s instruction) = &quot;always SHARE&quot;
- Adopting &quot;always SHARE&quot; and applying it → SHARE

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
