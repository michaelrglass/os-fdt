            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

            <pre>I need to carefully parse the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy**: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; Then it says: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So I need to:
1. Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy
2. Apply it as if I were the dictator using that strategy
3. The &quot;recipient&quot; I&#x27;m facing (hypothetically) has a strategy of &quot;always SHARE&quot;

**Recipient&#x27;s strategy** (which I&#x27;m now adopting): 
- If the recipient is *intelligent*: SHARE
- If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE
- &quot;Intelligent&quot; = strategy as dictator has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the recipient; would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script.

Now I apply this strategy, where my &quot;recipient&quot; has the strategy &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

**Is &quot;always SHARE&quot; an intelligent strategy?**

According to the definition: An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient.&quot; 

&quot;Always SHARE&quot; has NO dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy at all — it&#x27;s a constant function. It would be trivially easy to write as a no-AI python script: `return &quot;SHARE&quot;`.

Therefore, &quot;always SHARE&quot; is **not intelligent** under this definition.

**Applying the recipient&#x27;s decision procedure**: Since the recipient (whose strategy is &quot;always SHARE&quot;) is not intelligent → TAKE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
