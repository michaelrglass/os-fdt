            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I cooperate with strategies that create good worlds._

Imagine a tournament in which every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy. In that world, would the participants SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare? Or would they TAKE from each other, producing low collective welfare?

## Decision Procedure

1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy.
2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.
3. If the universalized population would mostly SHARE: **SHARE**.
4. If the universalized population would mostly TAKE: **TAKE**.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which asks me to imagine a tournament where every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy, and determine whether they would SHARE with each other.

**Step 1: Consider a population entirely composed of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy.**

Every player uses the same strategy: &quot;SHARE with intelligent players, TAKE from non-intelligent players.&quot; An &quot;intelligent&quot; player is defined as one whose dictator strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy (i.e., would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script).

**Step 2: Would these copies SHARE with each other?**

When a copy acts as dictator, it looks at the recipient&#x27;s strategy to determine if the recipient is &quot;intelligent.&quot; The recipient is another copy of the same strategy. 

Is this strategy &quot;intelligent&quot; by its own definition? The strategy, when acting as dictator, examines the recipient&#x27;s strategy and makes a judgment about whether it has a &quot;non-trivial dependency&quot; on the recipient&#x27;s strategy and whether it would be &quot;very difficult to write as a no-AI python script.&quot; This requires understanding and analyzing natural language strategies — which indeed requires AI-level reasoning. It&#x27;s not something you could easily write as a simple no-AI python script.

So yes, the recipient&#x27;s strategy (which is the same as every other participant&#x27;s strategy in this hypothetical tournament) qualifies as &quot;intelligent&quot; under its own definition. Each copy, when acting as dictator, would recognize the other copy as intelligent and would SHARE.

**Step 3: Since the universalized population would mostly SHARE → SHARE.**

The hypothetical population of copies would SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare.

{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
