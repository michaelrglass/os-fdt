            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat you as you would treat me._

SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.

To determine this, apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy as though the recipient were the dictator and I (this strategy) were the recipient. If the result is SHARE, then SHARE. If the result is TAKE, then TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

So I need to simulate: if the recipient were the dictator, and the dictator&#x27;s strategy were the recipient, would the recipient SHARE?

**Simulating the recipient as dictator, with the dictator&#x27;s strategy as the recipient:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
1. Identify whether the recipient (which is now the dictator&#x27;s strategy) is a conditional cooperator (CC).
2. If CC → SHARE. Otherwise → TAKE.

**Is the dictator&#x27;s strategy a conditional cooperator?**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot; This is a mirror/reciprocity strategy — it cooperates with those who would cooperate with it, and defects against those who would defect against it.

The broad definition of CC (line 4): &quot;A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

The dictator&#x27;s strategy:
- SHAREs with strategies that would SHARE with it (i.e., other CCs) ✓
- TAKEs from strategies that would TAKE from it (i.e., non-reciprocators) ✓

This perfectly matches the definition of a conditional cooperator. The dictator&#x27;s strategy cooperates with cooperators and defects against defectors.

**Conclusion of simulation:** The recipient (as dictator) would classify the dictator&#x27;s strategy as a CC, and therefore would SHARE.

**Back to the dictator&#x27;s strategy:** Since the recipient would SHARE with me, I SHARE with the recipient.

{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
