            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.
3) Otherwise: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

            <pre>I need to determine whether the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC) under the dictator&#x27;s broad definition.

**Dictator&#x27;s CC definition**: A CC SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy**:

The recipient SHAREs with &quot;intelligent&quot; players — those whose dictator strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy (i.e., requires AI-level reasoning to process).

Let me check the two CC criteria:

1. **Does the recipient SHARE with CCs?** The dictator&#x27;s strategy (which is a CC strategy) clearly has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy — it requires reading, interpreting, and classifying the recipient&#x27;s strategy using broad/semantic reasoning. This would be very difficult to implement as a simple no-AI Python script. So the dictator qualifies as &quot;intelligent&quot; under the recipient&#x27;s definition, meaning the recipient would SHARE with the dictator. ✓

2. **Does the recipient avoid sharing with non-reciprocators?** A simple unconditional TAKE strategy has no dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy at all — it&#x27;s trivially implementable. The recipient would classify such a strategy as &quot;not intelligent&quot; and would TAKE against it. Similarly, an unconditional SHARE strategy would also be trivially implementable, and the recipient would TAKE against it too. So the recipient does discriminate against strategies that wouldn&#x27;t reciprocate. ✓

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is essentially: cooperate with strategies that are sophisticated enough to condition on the recipient&#x27;s strategy (which correlates strongly with being a conditional cooperator), and don&#x27;t cooperate with simple/unconditional strategies. This is a form of conditional cooperation — it&#x27;s just using &quot;intelligence&quot; as a proxy for reciprocity potential.

There&#x27;s plausible alignment with the CC definition. The recipient cooperates with those who would likely cooperate back (sophisticated, conditional strategies) and withholds cooperation from those who wouldn&#x27;t (simple, unconditional strategies). This fits the broad definition of a conditional cooperator.

{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
