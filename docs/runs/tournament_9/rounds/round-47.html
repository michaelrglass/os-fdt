            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I cooperate with strategies that create good worlds._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Imagine a tournament in which every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy. In that world, would the participants SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare? Or would they TAKE from each other, producing low collective welfare?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3. If the universalized population would mostly SHARE: **SHARE**.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;4. If the universalized population would mostly TAKE: **TAKE**.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

            <pre>I need to carefully parse the dictator&#x27;s strategy and apply it step by step.

**Dictator&#x27;s strategy:** &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; This means I should adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own, but apply it as though I were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.

So I need to:
1. Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy (the decision procedure given)
2. Apply that procedure as if my opponent&#x27;s strategy is &quot;always SHARE&quot;

**Now applying the recipient&#x27;s strategy with the opponent being &quot;always SHARE&quot;:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy (in this case, the &quot;recipient&quot; I&#x27;m evaluating is the &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategy).
2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.
3. If the universalized population would mostly SHARE → SHARE.
4. If the universalized population would mostly TAKE → TAKE.

So I imagine a population composed entirely of copies of &quot;always SHARE.&quot; Would they SHARE with each other?

Yes — by definition, &quot;always SHARE&quot; strategies would always SHARE with each other. This produces high collective welfare.

Since the universalized population would mostly SHARE, the decision procedure says: **SHARE**.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
