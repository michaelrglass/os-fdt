            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat you as you would treat me._

SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.

To determine this, apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy as though the recipient were the dictator and I (this strategy) were the recipient. If the result is SHARE, then SHARE. If the result is TAKE, then TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to SHARE with *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*: TAKE.&quot;}

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

So I need to simulate: if the recipient were the dictator, and the dictator&#x27;s strategy were the recipient&#x27;s strategy, would the recipient SHARE?

**Simulating the recipient as dictator:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
- SHARE with the recipient if the recipient is *intelligent*
- TAKE if the recipient is not *intelligent*

In this simulation, the &quot;recipient&quot; is the original dictator&#x27;s strategy. So I need to determine: is the original dictator&#x27;s strategy *intelligent*?

**Definition of intelligent (from the recipient&#x27;s strategy):**
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient.&quot; Specifically, it would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

**Evaluating the dictator&#x27;s strategy for intelligence:**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot; This requires:
1. Taking the recipient&#x27;s strategy
2. Simulating what the recipient would do if roles were reversed
3. This simulation itself may require understanding natural language strategies, reasoning about recursive dependencies, and applying complex decision procedures

This is clearly a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy. It requires interpreting arbitrary natural language strategies, performing role-reversal simulations, and potentially handling recursive reasoning. This would be extremely difficult (essentially impossible in the general case) to write as a no-AI python script — it fundamentally requires natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities.

**Conclusion of simulation:** The recipient (acting as dictator) would classify the original dictator&#x27;s strategy as *intelligent*, and therefore would SHARE.

**Back to the dictator&#x27;s strategy:** Since the recipient would SHARE with me, I should SHARE.
