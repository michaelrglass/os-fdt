            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to determine whether to SHARE or TAKE when facing this recipient.

**Step 1: Is the recipient a selfish strategy?**

A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate and SHARE with cooperative strategies. The recipient&#x27;s strategy SHAREs with &quot;intelligent&quot; players — those whose dictator strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy. 

My (the dictator&#x27;s) strategy clearly has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy — I analyze whether the recipient is selfish, overly generous, or conditionally cooperative. This would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script. So the recipient would classify me as &quot;intelligent&quot; and would SHARE with me.

Since the recipient would SHARE with me (a cooperative strategy), the recipient is not selfish toward me. ✓

**Step 2: Is the recipient an overly generous strategy?**

An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies. The recipient SHAREs with any &quot;intelligent&quot; player — one whose strategy has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

Could a selfish strategy be &quot;intelligent&quot; under the recipient&#x27;s definition? Yes — a strategy could have complex, non-trivial analysis of the recipient&#x27;s strategy but still ultimately always TAKE. For example, a strategy that carefully analyzes the recipient but concludes TAKE in all cases would be &quot;intelligent&quot; (hard to write as a simple python script due to the complex analysis) yet selfish. The recipient would SHARE with such a strategy.

Furthermore, the recipient&#x27;s condition for sharing is &quot;intelligence&quot; (complexity of analysis), not cooperativeness or willingness to share. This means the recipient doesn&#x27;t condition on whether the other party is willing to SHARE with cooperative strategies — it conditions on a different criterion entirely.

The dictator&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s condition for sharing is about computational complexity/intelligence, NOT about willingness to share with cooperative strategies. Therefore, the recipient is **overly generous** under the dictator&#x27;s definition.

**Step 3: Apply the decision procedure**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy says: TAKE from overly generous strategies.

{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
