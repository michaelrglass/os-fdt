            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat you as you would treat me._

SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.

To determine this, apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy as though the recipient were the dictator and I (this strategy) were the recipient. If the result is SHARE, then SHARE. If the result is TAKE, then TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

So I need to simulate: if the recipient were the dictator, and the dictator&#x27;s strategy were the recipient&#x27;s strategy, what would the recipient do?

**Setting up the simulation:**
- New dictator: the recipient&#x27;s strategy
- New recipient: the dictator&#x27;s strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy (now acting as dictator) says:
1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the **new recipient&#x27;s** strategy (i.e., the dictator&#x27;s strategy).
2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.
3. If they would mostly SHARE → SHARE.
4. If they would mostly TAKE → TAKE.

So I need to ask: **In a population composed entirely of copies of the dictator&#x27;s strategy, would they SHARE with each other?**

**Analyzing a population of dictator-strategy copies:**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

In this hypothetical population, every player uses the dictator&#x27;s strategy. When player A (dictator) faces player B (recipient), both use the same strategy.

Player A applies: &quot;Would player B, acting as dictator, SHARE with me?&quot; Since B uses the same strategy as A, B would ask: &quot;Would A, acting as dictator, SHARE with me?&quot; This creates a symmetric recursive situation.

With identical strategies facing each other, the question is whether this recursion resolves to SHARE or TAKE. The dictator&#x27;s strategy is essentially a mirror/reciprocal strategy - &quot;treat you as you&#x27;d treat me.&quot; When two such strategies meet, the recursion is symmetric. There&#x27;s no inherent bias toward TAKE; the strategy is cooperative in nature (it reciprocates). 

In game theory, when two &quot;tit-for-tat&quot; or reciprocal strategies meet, they cooperate. The symmetric fixed point of &quot;I do what you&#x27;d do to me&quot; between two identical copies is SHARE (since SHARE is the cooperative equilibrium and there&#x27;s no reason for defection to emerge from symmetry).

Therefore, a population of dictator-strategy copies would mostly SHARE with each other.

**Back to the recipient&#x27;s strategy acting as dictator:**
Since the universalized population of the dictator&#x27;s strategy would mostly SHARE, the recipient&#x27;s strategy (as dictator) would SHARE with the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Back to the dictator&#x27;s strategy:**
Since the recipient would SHARE with me, I SHARE.
