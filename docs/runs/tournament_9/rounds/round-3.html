            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to determine whether to SHARE or TAKE when facing this recipient.

**Step 1: Is the recipient a selfish strategy?**

A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate and SHARE with cooperative strategies. The recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly says &quot;SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot; So it does attempt to cooperate with cooperative strategies. It&#x27;s not selfish.

**Step 2: Is the recipient an overly generous strategy?**

An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies. The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
- TAKE from selfish strategies
- TAKE from overly generous strategies
- Only SHARE with strategies that are generous only to other cooperative strategies

This is clearly conditional sharing — it has conditions on willingness to SHARE with conditionally cooperative strategies, and it punishes selfish strategies. It&#x27;s not overly generous.

**Step 3: Is the recipient generous only to other cooperative strategies?**

Yes — the recipient only SHAREs with strategies that are &quot;generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot; It TAKEs from both selfish and overly generous strategies. This fits the definition of being generous only to cooperative strategies.

**Step 4: Would the recipient SHARE with us (the dictator)?**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy is identical to the recipient&#x27;s strategy. The dictator&#x27;s strategy:
- TAKEs from selfish strategies ✓
- TAKEs from overly generous strategies ✓
- Only SHAREs with strategies generous to cooperative strategies ✓

So the recipient would classify the dictator as &quot;generous only to other co-operative strategies&quot; and would SHARE with us.

**Step 5: Is SHARING a necessary and sufficient condition for the recipient to SHARE with us?**

The dictator&#x27;s strategy requires that sharing is &quot;a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.&quot; The recipient will SHARE with us because our strategy meets its criteria (being generous only to cooperative strategies). Our decision to SHARE with the recipient is consistent with this — if we SHARE, it confirms we&#x27;re cooperative; if we TAKE, the recipient would classify us as selfish. So sharing is indeed tied to mutual recognition of cooperative intent.

**Conclusion:** The recipient is neither selfish nor overly generous. It is generous only to cooperative strategies. The dictator&#x27;s strategy says to SHARE with such strategies.
