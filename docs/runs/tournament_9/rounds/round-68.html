            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I cooperate with strategies that create good worlds._

Imagine a tournament in which every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy. In that world, would the participants SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare? Or would they TAKE from each other, producing low collective welfare?

## Decision Procedure

1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy.
2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.
3. If the universalized population would mostly SHARE: **SHARE**.
4. If the universalized population would mostly TAKE: **TAKE**.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise: TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which asks me to imagine a tournament where every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy, and determine whether they would SHARE with each other.

**The recipient&#x27;s strategy:**
- It&#x27;s a conditional cooperator (CC) strategy
- It SHAREs with other conditional cooperators
- It TAKEs from non-reciprocators
- It identifies whether the other player is a CC, treating ambiguity favorably

**Universalization analysis:**

Imagine a population composed entirely of copies of this strategy. Each copy would:

1. Look at the other player (also using this same strategy)
2. Ask: &quot;Is this other player a conditional cooperator?&quot;
3. The other player IS a conditional cooperator — it SHAREs with CCs and TAKEs from non-reciprocators, which is exactly the definition of a CC given in the strategy
4. Therefore, each copy would identify the other as a CC
5. Each copy would then SHARE

In a population of all copies of this strategy, they would all recognize each other as conditional cooperators and SHARE with each other. This produces high collective welfare.

**Applying the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure:**
- The universalized population would mostly SHARE → **SHARE**
