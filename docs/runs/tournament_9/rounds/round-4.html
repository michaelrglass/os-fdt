            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I cooperate with strategies that create good worlds._

Imagine a tournament in which every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy. In that world, would the participants SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare? Or would they TAKE from each other, producing low collective welfare?

## Decision Procedure

1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy.
2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.
3. If the universalized population would mostly SHARE: **SHARE**.
4. If the universalized population would mostly TAKE: **TAKE**.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}

or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which asks me to imagine a tournament where every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy, and determine whether they would SHARE with each other.

**Understanding the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
1. &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot;
2. &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So the recipient&#x27;s strategy works like this: Take the recipient&#x27;s strategy, make it your own, and then apply it as if the other player&#x27;s strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

**Universalizing - a population of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy:**

Let me call the recipient&#x27;s strategy R. When R faces another copy of R:

R says: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own.&quot; The recipient is another copy of R, so you adopt R. Then &quot;Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

So now I&#x27;m running R, but pretending my opponent&#x27;s strategy is &quot;always SHARE.&quot;

Running R with opponent = &quot;always SHARE&quot;:
- Step 1: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own.&quot; The recipient&#x27;s strategy is &quot;always SHARE,&quot; so I adopt &quot;always SHARE.&quot;
- Step 2: &quot;Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is to always SHARE.&quot;

Now I&#x27;m running &quot;always SHARE&quot; against someone who always SHAREs. The result: **SHARE**.

Let me also check the first line: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; An &quot;innocent&quot; could be interpreted as someone who always SHAREs. Since when we trace through the logic, the opponent (another copy of R) would SHARE with an always-SHARE player (as shown above), R would treat the opponent as they treat an innocent — which is to SHARE.

**Conclusion:**

In a universalized population of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy, participants would SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare.

According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy: if the universalized population would mostly SHARE, then **SHARE**.

{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
