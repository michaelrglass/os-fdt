            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.
3) Otherwise: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to determine if the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC) under the dictator&#x27;s broad definition.

**Dictator&#x27;s CC definition**: A CC SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy**:

1. **Does the recipient SHARE with other CCs?** Yes. Line 17 says &quot;SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot; This means the recipient shares with strategies that conditionally cooperate — i.e., other CCs.

2. **Does the recipient avoid sharing with non-reciprocators?** Yes. Line 16 says &quot;TAKE from both selfish strategies and overly generous strategies.&quot; Selfish strategies are non-reciprocators (line 7). The recipient also TAKEs from &quot;overly generous&quot; strategies — those that share with selfish strategies (lines 10-13).

3. **Is the additional condition (punishing overly generous strategies) consistent with being a CC?** The recipient not only refuses to share with non-reciprocators, but also refuses to share with strategies that are generous toward non-reciprocators. This is a stricter form of conditional cooperation. However, under the dictator&#x27;s broad definition, this still fits: the recipient shares with CCs and doesn&#x27;t extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate. Overly generous strategies, from this recipient&#x27;s perspective, are not true conditional cooperators because they share indiscriminately.

4. **Would the recipient SHARE with the dictator&#x27;s strategy?** The dictator&#x27;s strategy shares only with CCs and takes from non-CCs. This means the dictator is &quot;generous only to other co-operative strategies,&quot; which matches the recipient&#x27;s criterion on line 17. So the recipient would SHARE with the dictator.

5. **Is this a CC under the broad definition (with plausible ambiguity treated as CC)?** Yes. The recipient cooperates with conditional cooperators and withholds cooperation from non-reciprocators. The additional strictness about &quot;overly generous&quot; strategies is a refinement of conditional cooperation — it&#x27;s still fundamentally about only cooperating with those who maintain reciprocity norms.

**Conclusion**: The recipient qualifies as a CC. Decision: SHARE.
