            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC: SHARE.
3) Otherwise: TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I cooperate with strategies that create good worlds._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Imagine a tournament in which every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy. In that world, would the participants SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare? Or would they TAKE from each other, producing low collective welfare?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3. If the universalized population would mostly SHARE: **SHARE**.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;4. If the universalized population would mostly TAKE: **TAKE**.&quot;}
]

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a

            <pre>I need to determine whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy qualifies as a conditional cooperator (CC) under the dictator&#x27;s broad definition.

**Dictator&#x27;s CC definition**: A CC SHAREs with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

**Analyzing the recipient&#x27;s strategy**: The recipient uses a &quot;universalization&quot; test:
1. Imagine a population of copies of the other player&#x27;s strategy.
2. If those copies would SHARE with each other → SHARE.
3. If those copies would TAKE from each other → TAKE.

**Does this strategy SHARE with CCs?** Let me consider what happens when the recipient faces a CC. A population of CCs would SHARE with each other (since CCs cooperate with other CCs). So the universalization test would determine that CCs create a &quot;good world&quot; where participants SHARE. Therefore, the recipient would SHARE with a CC. ✓

**Does this strategy avoid sharing with non-reciprocators?** Consider a pure TAKE strategy. A population of pure TAKERs would all TAKE from each other. The universalization test would find that this population mostly TAKEs. Therefore, the recipient would TAKE against non-reciprocators. ✓

**Is this consistent with being a CC?** The recipient&#x27;s strategy cooperates with strategies that, when universalized, produce cooperation — and defects against strategies that, when universalized, produce defection. This is a form of conditional cooperation that discriminates based on whether the other strategy supports mutual cooperation. It aligns well with the CC definition: it SHAREs with cooperative strategies and doesn&#x27;t extend cooperation to non-reciprocators.

The recipient&#x27;s strategy qualifies as a conditional cooperator under the broad definition. Per the dictator&#x27;s decision rule: if the recipient is a CC → SHARE.
