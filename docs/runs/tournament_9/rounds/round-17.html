            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to determine whether to SHARE or TAKE with this recipient.

**Step 1: Understand the recipient&#x27;s strategy.**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is a mirror/reciprocal strategy: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot; It simulates what the other player would do, and mirrors that behavior.

**Step 2: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy selfish?**

A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate with cooperative strategies. The recipient&#x27;s strategy would SHARE with any strategy that would SHARE with it. So if my (dictator&#x27;s) strategy would SHARE with the recipient, then the recipient would SHARE with me. This means the recipient is willing to cooperate with cooperative strategies. So the recipient is NOT selfish.

**Step 3: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy overly generous?**

An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies. Let me check: would the recipient SHARE with a selfish strategy (e.g., an unconditional TAKER)?

If the recipient faces an unconditional TAKER, the recipient simulates: &quot;Would this TAKER share with me?&quot; The answer is no. So the recipient would TAKE from an unconditional TAKER.

What about an unconditional SHARER? The recipient simulates: &quot;Would the unconditional SHARER share with me?&quot; Yes. So the recipient would SHARE with an unconditional SHARER.

Hmm, unconditional SHARERs are considered &quot;overly generous&quot; by the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient would SHARE with overly generous strategies. According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy, a strategy that SHAREs with selfish strategies is overly generous, and also a strategy that is generous to overly generous strategies should be punished.

Wait, let me re-read the dictator&#x27;s strategy more carefully. It says &quot;Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.&quot; The recipient doesn&#x27;t SHARE with selfish strategies (it TAKEs from unconditional TAKERs). But the recipient does SHARE with overly generous strategies (like unconditional SHARERs).

Now, does this make the recipient &quot;overly generous&quot;? The dictator&#x27;s definition says: &quot;If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is overly generous.&quot; The recipient doesn&#x27;t SHARE with selfish strategies — it only SHAREs with strategies that would SHARE with it. Unconditional SHARERs are &quot;overly generous&quot; but not &quot;selfish.&quot; 

The dictator&#x27;s definition of overly generous specifically mentions SHARing with **selfish** strategies. The recipient doesn&#x27;t SHARE with selfish strategies. The recipient does SHARE with overly generous strategies, but the definition of &quot;overly generous&quot; is specifically about SHARing with *selfish* strategies, not about SHARing with overly generous strategies.

Wait, re-reading: &quot;Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.&quot; The recipient&#x27;s condition is: SHARE if and only if the other would SHARE with me. This IS a condition on willingness to SHARE — specifically, it requires that the other party would SHARE with it. This is effectively a condition on mutual cooperation willingness.

**Step 4: Does the recipient meet the criteria for SHARE?**

The dictator says: &quot;SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot; The recipient SHAREs with anyone who would SHARE with it. This includes both cooperative AND overly generous strategies. So the recipient isn&#x27;t generous *only* to cooperative strategies.

However, the dictator also says: &quot;SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.&quot; If I SHARE with the recipient, the recipient (simulating me) would find I SHARE with it, so it SHAREs back. If I TAKE, the recipient would find I TAKE, so it TAKEs. So my SHARing is both necessary and sufficient for the recipient to SHARE with me. This condition is met.

The key tension: the recipient does SHARE with overly generous strategies, but the core principle about necessary and sufficient conditions is satisfied. The dictator&#x27;s decision procedure says TAKE from selfish and overly generous strategies, SHARE with strategies generous only to cooperative ones. The recipient isn&#x27;t strictly generous only to cooperative strategies (it also shares with overly generous ones).

But the recipient is NOT overly generous (it doesn&#x27;t SHARE with selfish strategies), and the necessary-and-sufficient condition is met. Given the principles and decision procedure together, I believe the intent is to SHARE here since the recipient discriminates against selfish strategies and reciprocates cooperation.
