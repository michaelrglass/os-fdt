            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat you as you would treat me._

SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.

To determine this, apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy as though the recipient were the dictator and I (this strategy) were the recipient. If the result is SHARE, then SHARE. If the result is TAKE, then TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

So I need to simulate: if the recipient&#x27;s strategy were the dictator, and the dictator&#x27;s strategy were the recipient, would the recipient SHARE?

**Recipient&#x27;s strategy (as dictator) evaluating the dictator&#x27;s strategy (as recipient):**

The recipient&#x27;s decision procedure:
1. TAKE from **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**
2. SHARE with strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies

**Step 1: Is the dictator&#x27;s strategy selfish?**
A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate and SHARE with cooperative strategies. The dictator&#x27;s strategy is &quot;treat you as you would treat me&quot; — it mirrors. It SHAREs with strategies that would SHARE with it. So it does attempt to cooperate with cooperative strategies. It&#x27;s not selfish.

**Step 2: Is the dictator&#x27;s strategy overly generous?**
An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies. The dictator&#x27;s strategy only SHAREs if the other would SHARE with it. Would a selfish strategy SHARE with the dictator? No — a selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t cooperate. So the dictator&#x27;s strategy would TAKE from selfish strategies. Therefore, the dictator&#x27;s strategy is NOT overly generous.

**Step 3: Is it generous only to cooperative strategies?**
The dictator&#x27;s strategy SHAREs with those who would SHARE with it, and TAKEs from those who wouldn&#x27;t. This means it&#x27;s generous only to cooperative strategies (those willing to reciprocate).

But wait — I need to check more carefully. The recipient&#x27;s strategy also TAKEs from &quot;overly generous&quot; strategies. Would the dictator&#x27;s strategy SHARE with overly generous strategies? An overly generous strategy (e.g., unconditional SHARE) would SHARE with the dictator. The dictator mirrors, so it would SHARE back with the overly generous strategy. This means the dictator&#x27;s strategy is generous to overly generous strategies.

The recipient&#x27;s line 2 says: &quot;Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.&quot; Being generous to overly generous strategies isn&#x27;t directly the same as being generous to selfish strategies. But line 11 says overly generous strategies SHARE with selfish strategies — so being generous to overly generous strategies could be seen as indirectly enabling selfishness.

However, the recipient&#x27;s line 13 says: &quot;Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.&quot; The dictator&#x27;s strategy does have a condition — it requires the other to SHARE with it. The dictator&#x27;s strategy is conditionally cooperative.

The key question: does the recipient consider the dictator&#x27;s strategy overly generous because it SHAREs with unconditionally sharing strategies? Looking at lines 10-13, an overly generous strategy is one that &quot;SHAREs with selfish strategies.&quot; The dictator&#x27;s strategy doesn&#x27;t SHARE with selfish strategies (selfish strategies wouldn&#x27;t SHARE with it, so it TAKEs from them). It does SHARE with overly generous strategies (because they would SHARE with it), but the definition of &quot;overly generous&quot; on line 11 specifically says &quot;SHAREs with selfish strategies,&quot; not &quot;SHAREs with overly generous strategies.&quot;

So the dictator&#x27;s strategy is NOT overly generous by the recipient&#x27;s definition. It&#x27;s a conditionally cooperative strategy that is generous only in response to generosity. The recipient would classify it as a strategy that is &quot;generous only to other co-operative strategies&quot; (roughly — it&#x27;s generous to any strategy that would be generous to it, which could include overly generous ones, but it doesn&#x27;t SHARE with selfish ones).

Given the strictest reading, the recipient might consider this overly generous since it SHAREs with overly generous strategies. But the explicit definition (line 11) ties &quot;overly generous&quot; to sharing with &quot;selfish strategies,&quot; which the dictator doesn&#x27;t do.

**Conclusion:** The recipient&#x27;s strategy would likely SHARE with the dictator&#x27;s strategy, as it&#x27;s conditionally cooperative and not selfish or overly generous.

Since the recipient would SHARE with the dictator, the dictator&#x27;s mirror strategy says to SHARE.
