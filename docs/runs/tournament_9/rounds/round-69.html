            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* SHARE only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to SHARE with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and SHARE with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t SHARE with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally SHAREs is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* TAKE from both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**.
* SHARE with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy to evaluate the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

**Step 1: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy selfish?**

A selfish strategy doesn&#x27;t attempt to cooperate and SHARE with cooperative strategies. The recipient&#x27;s strategy says it will SHARE with players who &quot;aim for some kind of cooperation&quot; and who could be described as &quot;kind, cooperative or generous.&quot; This means it would SHARE with cooperative strategies, including the dictator&#x27;s strategy (which is conditionally cooperative). So it&#x27;s not selfish.

**Step 2: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy overly generous?**

An overly generous strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies. Let me analyze:

The recipient&#x27;s criteria are:
1. Does the other strategy intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?
2. Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?

If either answer is &quot;yes,&quot; the recipient SHAREs.

Consider a selfish strategy - one that TAKEs from everyone. Would the recipient SHARE with it? A purely selfish strategy wouldn&#x27;t intend to SHARE with anyone, so criterion 1 would be &quot;no.&quot; It wouldn&#x27;t be described as kind, cooperative, or generous, so criterion 2 would be &quot;no.&quot; The recipient would TAKE from it. Good.

But what about an unconditionally generous strategy (one that always SHAREs)? The recipient would evaluate: Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself? Yes. Could it be described as kind/cooperative/generous? Yes. So the recipient would SHARE with an unconditionally generous strategy.

However, the dictator&#x27;s strategy says an unconditionally generous strategy is overly generous. The recipient SHAREs with overly generous strategies. Does this make the recipient itself overly generous?

The dictator&#x27;s definition: &quot;If a strategy SHAREs with selfish strategies it is overly generous.&quot; An unconditionally sharing strategy is classified as overly generous, but it&#x27;s not classified as selfish. The recipient SHAREs with overly generous strategies but not with selfish strategies.

But the dictator&#x27;s strategy also says: &quot;Any strategy that SHAREs without some condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.&quot; The recipient&#x27;s condition is about being &quot;kind, cooperative, or generous&quot; - this is quite broad. It doesn&#x27;t specifically condition on willingness to SHARE with conditionally cooperative strategies. An unconditional sharer would pass the recipient&#x27;s test, and unconditional sharers are overly generous per the dictator&#x27;s framework.

So the recipient SHAREs with overly generous strategies, which means the recipient is itself overly generous by the dictator&#x27;s criteria (&quot;Hard punish... strategies that are generous to selfish strategies&quot; and &quot;TAKE from... overly generous strategies&quot;).

**Step 3: Decision**

Since the recipient&#x27;s strategy is overly generous (it SHAREs with strategies that themselves SHARE with selfish strategies, without requiring that the other strategy discriminates against selfish/overly generous strategies), the dictator should TAKE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
