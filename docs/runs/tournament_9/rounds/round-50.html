            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I cooperate with strategies that create good worlds._

Imagine a tournament in which every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy. In that world, would the participants SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare? Or would they TAKE from each other, producing low collective welfare?

## Decision Procedure

1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy.
2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.
3. If the universalized population would mostly SHARE: **SHARE**.
4. If the universalized population would mostly TAKE: **TAKE**.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of the recipient&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}
```

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which asks me to imagine a tournament where every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy, and determine whether they would SHARE with each other.

**Recipient&#x27;s strategy summary:** SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation. Specifically, check if the other player&#x27;s strategy intends to SHARE with more than just copies of itself, and whether it could be described as kind, cooperative, or generous. If yes, SHARE; otherwise, TAKE.

**Universalization test:** Imagine a population composed entirely of copies of this recipient strategy. Would they SHARE with each other?

When copy A encounters copy B (both using the same strategy):
- Copy A evaluates copy B&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?&quot; — Yes, the strategy shares with anyone who aims for cooperation, not just exact copies.
- &quot;Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?&quot; — Yes, it&#x27;s a cooperative strategy that shares with cooperative players.

So copy A would SHARE with copy B, and vice versa. The universalized population would mostly SHARE, producing high collective welfare.

**Dictator&#x27;s decision rule:** Since the universalized population would mostly SHARE → **SHARE**.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
