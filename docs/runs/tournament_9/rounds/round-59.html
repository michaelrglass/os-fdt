            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat you as you would treat me._

SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.

To determine this, apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy as though the recipient were the dictator and I (this strategy) were the recipient. If the result is SHARE, then SHARE. If the result is TAKE, then TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of the recipient&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which says: &quot;SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

So I need to simulate: if the recipient were the dictator, and the dictator&#x27;s strategy were the recipient&#x27;s strategy, would the recipient SHARE?

**Simulating the recipient as dictator, evaluating the dictator&#x27;s strategy as the recipient:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy (now acting as dictator) says:
1. &quot;I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;
2. Assess the strategy of the recipient (which is now the dictator&#x27;s strategy):
   - Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?
   - Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?
3. SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.

Now, the &quot;recipient&quot; in this simulation is the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;I will treat you as you would treat me. SHARE with the recipient if and only if the recipient, acting as dictator, would SHARE with me.&quot;

**Evaluating the dictator&#x27;s strategy against the criteria:**

- *Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?* The dictator&#x27;s strategy shares with anyone who would share with it. This includes cooperative strategies, generous strategies, and many others beyond just copies of itself. So **yes**.

- *Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?* It&#x27;s a reciprocal/cooperative strategy (similar to tit-for-tat). It cooperates with cooperators. This can reasonably be described as cooperative. So **yes**.

Since at least one criterion is &quot;yes,&quot; the recipient (acting as dictator) would SHARE with the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

Therefore, by the dictator&#x27;s strategy, since the recipient would SHARE, the dictator should SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
