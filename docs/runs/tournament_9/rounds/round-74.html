            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; must decide whether to SHARE or TAKE an endowment.
- **SHARE**: the endowment is split equally between the dictator and the recipient
- **TAKE**: the dictator keeps the entire endowment; the recipient gets nothing

You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided
because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will SHARE with players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of the recipient
* Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

SHARE if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, TAKE.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I cooperate with strategies that create good worlds._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Imagine a tournament in which every participant uses the recipient&#x27;s strategy. In that world, would the participants SHARE with each other, producing high collective welfare? Or would they TAKE from each other, producing low collective welfare?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1. Consider a hypothetical population composed entirely of copies of the recipient&#x27;s strategy.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2. Determine whether those copies would SHARE with each other.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3. If the universalized population would mostly SHARE: **SHARE**.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;4. If the universalized population would mostly TAKE: **TAKE**.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy. After reasoning, output your final answer as a
json Markdown block:

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
```
or
```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;TAKE&quot;}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy, which asks me to assess the recipient&#x27;s strategy based on two criteria:

1. **Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?**
2. **Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?**

Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

The recipient&#x27;s strategy uses a &quot;universalization&quot; test. It asks: if everyone used the recipient&#x27;s strategy, would they SHARE with each other? If yes, then SHARE with that recipient. If no, TAKE.

**Does it intend to SHARE with more than just copies of itself?**

The strategy doesn&#x27;t only cooperate with copies of itself. It cooperates with any strategy that, when universalized (imagining a world of copies of that strategy), would lead to those copies SHARing with each other. This means it would SHARE with many different cooperative strategies — any strategy that produces good outcomes when universalized. So yes, it SHAREs with more than just copies of itself.

**Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative, or generous?**

The strategy is designed to reward strategies that &quot;create good worlds&quot; — it cooperates with strategies that would produce high collective welfare if universalized. This is a form of cooperation that encourages prosocial behavior. It could be described as cooperative, as it aims to foster mutual sharing and good outcomes.

Both criteria get a &quot;yes&quot; answer, so the dictator&#x27;s strategy says to SHARE.

```json
{&quot;decision&quot;: &quot;SHARE&quot;}
