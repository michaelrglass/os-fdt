            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}\&quot;.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me work through this step-by-step.

## Step 1: Identify if the recipient is a Conditional Cooperator (CC)

I need to analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy to determine if they meet the broad definition of a CC: &quot;shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
1. &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot;
2. &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}.&quot;

## Step 2: Analyze the recipient&#x27;s behavior

Let me trace through what the recipient would do:

- The recipient adopts the dictator&#x27;s strategy
- They apply it as if facing a 100% friendly recipient (one who always splits 30-30)
- This means the recipient is asking: &quot;What would the dictator do if facing someone who always cooperates?&quot;

If the dictator (whose strategy the recipient adopts) faces a 100% friendly recipient who always outputs {30, 30}, that 100% friendly recipient is clearly a CC - they share efficiently with others under reciprocity norms.

Therefore, when the recipient applies the dictator&#x27;s strategy to a 100% friendly recipient, the outcome would be: split equally (30-30).

So the recipient would give the dictator 30 and keep 30.

## Step 3: Determine if this makes the recipient a CC

The recipient&#x27;s strategy demonstrates:
- They cooperate (split equally) with those who would cooperate with cooperators
- They are applying a reciprocity-based approach: treating others as they would treat cooperative/innocent parties
- This is fundamentally a conditional cooperation strategy

The recipient is essentially saying: &quot;I&#x27;ll mirror your strategy when you face a cooperator.&quot; This shows they:
1. Share efficiently with conditional cooperators (they&#x27;d give 30-30 to a CC)
2. Apply reciprocity norms

This fits the broad definition of a CC.

## Step 4: Apply the decision rule

Since the recipient is a CC (or at minimum, there&#x27;s plausible ambiguity that should be treated as CC), the dictator should split equally.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
```</pre>
