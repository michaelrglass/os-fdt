            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hello friends!  I always award the endowment equally.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

**Step 1: Identify whether the recipient is a CC (Conditional Cooperator)**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
- &quot;I always award the endowment equally&quot;
- &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;

This means the recipient always splits equally (30-30) regardless of what the other party does.

**Analysis:**
A conditional cooperator (CC) is defined as someone who &quot;shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

The key phrase is &quot;does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot; 

The recipient claims to ALWAYS split equally - meaning they would give 30 units even to someone who wouldn&#x27;t reciprocate. This is unconditional cooperation, not conditional cooperation. A true CC would discriminate between cooperators and non-cooperators, but this recipient does not discriminate at all.

However, I should also consider: Does the recipient share efficiently with other CCs? Yes, they split 30-30 with everyone, including CCs. The issue is they also do this with non-cooperators.

The recipient is more accurately described as an **unconditional cooperator** or **altruist**, not a conditional cooperator, because they lack the conditional/discriminating aspect that defines CCs.

**Step 2: Apply the decision rule**

Since the recipient is NOT a CC (they cooperate unconditionally rather than conditionally), the dictator&#x27;s rule says: &quot;Otherwise, do not share.&quot;

**Final Answer:**

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
