            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* Split evenly only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to split with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally splits is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that splits without some condition on williness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**
* Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hello friends!  I always award the endowment equally.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

## Analysis of the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states: &quot;I always award the endowment equally&quot; and &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;

### Is this strategy selfish?
According to the dictator&#x27;s definition, a selfish strategy &quot;doesn&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly states it ALWAYS splits equally (30-30). This means:
- It does attempt to reach an equal division
- It would split evenly with the dictator&#x27;s strategy

So this is **not a selfish strategy**.

### Is this strategy overly generous?
According to the dictator&#x27;s definition, a strategy is overly generous if:
- It awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies
- It unconditionally splits
- It splits without some condition on willingness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- States &quot;I ALWAYS award the endowment equally&quot;
- This is unconditional - it splits with everyone, including selfish strategies
- It has no conditions checking if the other party is cooperative

Therefore, this strategy **is overly generous**.

### Decision
According to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure: &quot;Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**&quot;

Since the recipient&#x27;s strategy is overly generous (it unconditionally splits even with selfish strategies), the dictator should award 0 to the recipient.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
