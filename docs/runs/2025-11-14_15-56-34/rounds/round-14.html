            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}
```</pre>

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy meets the definition of &quot;intelligent&quot; according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

## Analysis of the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
1. They will assess whether other players &quot;aim for some kind of cooperation&quot;
2. They evaluate if strategies intend to split the endowment beyond just copies of itself
3. They assess if strategies could be described as &quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot;
4. They split equally if these criteria are met, otherwise take everything

## Evaluating &quot;Intelligence&quot; According to the Dictator&#x27;s Definition

The dictator defines an intelligent player as one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a **non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;** and would be **very difficult to write as a no-AI python script**.

Let me assess the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

**Does it have non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy?**
Yes. The recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly requires:
- Reading and understanding the recipient&#x27;s strategy text
- Making qualitative judgments about intent (&quot;aims for cooperation&quot;)
- Interpreting subjective qualities (&quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot;)
- Understanding semantic meaning beyond simple pattern matching

**Would it be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script?**
Yes. The strategy requires:
- Natural language understanding to assess &quot;intent&quot; and &quot;cooperation&quot;
- Semantic analysis of strategy descriptions
- Subjective judgment calls that can&#x27;t be reduced to simple rules
- Understanding context and nuance in how strategies are described

This is clearly not a simple rule-based system. You cannot write a straightforward script that takes a strategy string and reliably determines if it &quot;aims for cooperation&quot; or is &quot;kind&quot; without sophisticated NLP or AI capabilities.

## Conclusion

The recipient&#x27;s strategy IS intelligent according to the dictator&#x27;s definition because it has a substantive, non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy and requires complex interpretation that would be very difficult to implement as a simple python script.

Therefore, according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure, the split should be even.
