            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}`&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}`&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy qualifies as &quot;intelligent&quot; according to the dictator&#x27;s definition.

## Analysis

The dictator&#x27;s definition of an &quot;intelligent&quot; player is:
- A player whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a **non-trivial dependency** on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;
- A strategy that would be **very difficult to write as a no-AI python script** taking the recipient&#x27;s strategy as input

## Examining the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
1. It evaluates whether the OTHER player (when that player is dictator) is &quot;intelligent&quot;
2. It defines &quot;intelligent&quot; as having non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy
3. It splits evenly (30/30) if the other player is intelligent, otherwise takes everything (60/0)

## Key Observation

The recipient&#x27;s strategy **does have a non-trivial dependency** on the dictator&#x27;s (recipient&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s) strategy. Specifically:

- The recipient must analyze and evaluate the complexity of the dictator&#x27;s strategy
- The recipient must determine if that strategy has &quot;non-trivial dependency&quot; - this requires understanding and reasoning about the opponent&#x27;s decision-making process
- This evaluation would indeed be **very difficult to write as a simple no-AI python script** because it requires:
  - Understanding natural language strategy descriptions
  - Evaluating logical complexity and dependencies
  - Making judgment calls about what constitutes &quot;non-trivial dependency&quot;

## Conclusion

The recipient&#x27;s strategy meets the definition of &quot;intelligent&quot; because:
1. It has non-trivial dependency on the opponent&#x27;s strategy (it must analyze and evaluate it)
2. Implementing this evaluation in a simple Python script would be very difficult without AI capabilities

According to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure, when the recipient is intelligent, the split should be even.
