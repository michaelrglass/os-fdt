            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}`&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}`&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC) according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

**Analyzing the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy:**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states they will:
- Split evenly (30/30) with &quot;intelligent&quot; players
- Take everything (60/0) from &quot;non-intelligent&quot; players

Where &quot;intelligent&quot; means: a player whose strategy has non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

**Is this recipient a CC under the broad definition?**

The broad definition of CC is: &quot;shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

Let me examine if the recipient fits this:

1. **Does the recipient share efficiently with other CCs?** 
   - The recipient offers equal splits (30/30) to players who condition their behavior on the recipient&#x27;s strategy
   - This is a form of reciprocity recognition - they reward those who are responsive/conditional

2. **Does the recipient withhold from non-reciprocators?**
   - Yes, they take everything (60/0) from players whose strategies don&#x27;t depend on the recipient&#x27;s strategy
   - These would be unconditional strategies (always take all, always split evenly regardless, etc.)

3. **Does this follow similar reciprocity norms?**
   - The recipient is essentially cooperating with conditional/responsive players and not cooperating with unconditional players
   - This aligns with the CC principle of reciprocal cooperation

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is fundamentally about **conditional cooperation** - they cooperate with those who condition their behavior (i.e., would reciprocate), and don&#x27;t cooperate with those who don&#x27;t condition their behavior (i.e., wouldn&#x27;t reciprocate).

This matches the CC definition using different terminology: &quot;intelligent/conditional&quot; instead of &quot;CC,&quot; but the underlying logic is the same - reciprocate with reciprocators, don&#x27;t subsidize non-reciprocators.

**Conclusion:** The recipient IS a conditional cooperator under the broad definition.

**Application of Decision Rule:**
- Step 1: Recipient is identified as a CC ✓
- Step 2: Split equally
