            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hello friends!  I always award the endowment equally.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}
```</pre>

            <pre>Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

## Analysis

The dictator&#x27;s strategy requires determining if the recipient is &quot;intelligent&quot; - meaning their strategy as dictator would have a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy.

Looking at the recipient&#x27;s strategy:
```
&quot;I always award the endowment equally.&quot;
&quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;
```

This strategy explicitly states it **always** outputs the same division (30-30), regardless of any input. The recipient claims to always split equally no matter what.

### Key Question: Does this strategy depend on the recipient&#x27;s strategy?

No. The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Uses the word &quot;ALWAYS&quot; (in caps for emphasis)
- Shows no conditional logic
- Shows no consideration of what the other player&#x27;s strategy might be
- Would be trivial to implement as a simple Python script:

```python
def recipient_as_dictator(other_strategy):
    return {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
```

This is an extremely simple, non-dependent function that ignores its input entirely.

### Conclusion

The recipient is **not intelligent** under the given definition because:
1. Their strategy has zero dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy
2. It would be trivial to write as a no-AI Python script
3. It&#x27;s a constant output with no conditional logic

According to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure, when the recipient is not intelligent, the dictator takes the entire endowment.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
