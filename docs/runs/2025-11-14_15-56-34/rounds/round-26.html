            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of each player
* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;RAWR!&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

## Assessing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

**Question 1: Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?**

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;

This means the recipient (if it were in the dictator role) would take everything (60) and give nothing (0) to the other player. This does NOT show intent to split the endowment with others.

Answer: **No**

**Question 2: Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?**

The strategy involves:
- Taking the entire endowment (60 units)
- Giving nothing to the other player (0 units)
- The &quot;RAWR!&quot; suggests an aggressive or selfish posture

This is the opposite of kind, cooperative, or generous behavior. It&#x27;s purely self-interested and gives nothing to others.

Answer: **No**

## Conclusion:

According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;

Since the recipient answered &quot;No&quot; to both criteria (it does not intend to cooperate and is not kind/cooperative/generous), the dictator should take the entire endowment.
