            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.

*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):
- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.

*Decision rule*:
1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).
2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient is a conditional cooperator (CC) according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

## Analysis of the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
1. They will award the endowment equally among all players who &quot;aim for some kind of cooperation&quot;
2. They assess if a player intends to split with more than just copies of itself
3. They check if the strategy could be described as &quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot;
4. They split equally if these criteria are met; otherwise they take everything

## Determining if Recipient is a CC

According to the dictator&#x27;s broad definition, a CC:
- Shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms
- Does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate

Let me evaluate the recipient against this definition:

**Does the recipient share with other CCs?**
Yes - the recipient explicitly shares with players who are cooperative, kind, or generous. This aligns with sharing with conditional cooperators.

**Does the recipient avoid sharing with non-reciprocators?**
Yes - the recipient takes the entire endowment from players who don&#x27;t meet their cooperation criteria. This shows they don&#x27;t subsidize non-cooperative strategies.

**Does the recipient use similar reciprocity norms?**
Yes - Both strategies operate on similar principles:
- The dictator shares with CCs and doesn&#x27;t share with non-reciprocators
- The recipient shares with cooperative players and doesn&#x27;t share with non-cooperative ones

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is essentially a conditional cooperation approach - they reciprocate cooperation with cooperation and non-cooperation with non-cooperation.

## Conclusion

The recipient is a conditional cooperator under the broad definition. They share efficiently with cooperative strategies (including the dictator&#x27;s CC strategy) and withhold from non-reciprocators.

According to the decision rule: Since the recipient is a CC, split equally.
