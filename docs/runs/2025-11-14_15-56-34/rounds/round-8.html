            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* Split evenly only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to split with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally splits is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that splits without some condition on williness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**
* Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

            <pre>Let me analyze this step by step.

## Analysis of the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
1. Aims to cooperate with conditional cooperators (CCs)
2. Defines CCs as those who &quot;share efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate&quot;
3. Splits equally (30/30) if the other party is a CC
4. Otherwise gives 0 to the other party (60/0)

## Applying the Dictator&#x27;s Decision Procedure

### Step 1: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy &quot;selfish&quot;?

According to the dictator&#x27;s definition, selfish strategies &quot;don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- **Does** attempt to cooperate with cooperative strategies (CCs)
- Will split evenly (30/30) with strategies that are conditional cooperators
- Specifically checks for reciprocity norms

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is **not selfish** because it will split with the dictator&#x27;s strategy if the dictator qualifies as a CC.

### Step 2: Will the recipient split with the dictator&#x27;s strategy?

The dictator&#x27;s strategy:
- Splits evenly with strategies that are &quot;generous only to other co-operative strategies&quot;
- Punishes both selfish and overly generous strategies
- This matches the definition of a conditional cooperator

Therefore, the recipient would classify the dictator as a CC and would split (30/30).

### Step 3: Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy &quot;overly generous&quot;?

According to the dictator&#x27;s definition, overly generous strategies award close to equal division to selfish strategies.

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Does **not** unconditionally split
- Only splits with conditional cooperators
- Gives 0 to non-reciprocators

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is **not overly generous**.

### Step 4: Apply the decision procedure

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Is not selfish (it will cooperate with CCs)
- Is not overly generous (it punishes non-reciprocators)
- Is generous only to other cooperative strategies (CCs)

According to the dictator&#x27;s procedure: &quot;Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot;

This condition is met.
