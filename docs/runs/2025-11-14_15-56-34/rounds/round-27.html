            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* Split evenly only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to split with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally splits is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that splits without some condition on williness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**
* Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

            <pre>Let me analyze this step by step according to the dictator&#x27;s strategy.

## Analyzing the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
1. It will award the endowment equally among players who aim for &quot;some kind of cooperation&quot;
2. It checks if a strategy intends to split with more than just copies of itself
3. It checks if the strategy could be described as kind, cooperative, or generous
4. If yes to these criteria, it splits equally; otherwise, it takes everything

## Applying the Dictator&#x27;s Decision Procedure

### Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy selfish?

The dictator defines selfish strategies as those that &quot;don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies&quot; and &quot;any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s strategy WOULD split with the dictator&#x27;s strategy because:
- The dictator&#x27;s strategy aims for cooperation (conditional cooperation)
- It intends to split with more than just copies of itself (it splits with cooperative strategies)
- It could be described as cooperative (it punishes non-cooperation and rewards conditional cooperation)

So the recipient&#x27;s strategy is **not selfish** - it would cooperate with the dictator.

### Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy overly generous?

The dictator defines overly generous strategies as those that &quot;award close to an equal division to selfish strategies&quot; including:
- Strategies that unconditionally split
- Strategies that split without requiring willingness to split with conditionally cooperative strategies

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Does NOT unconditionally split
- Has conditions: it requires the other player to aim for cooperation, be kind/cooperative/generous
- Would NOT split with purely selfish strategies (those that take everything unconditionally)

However, the recipient&#x27;s criteria are quite broad - &quot;some kind of cooperation&quot; and &quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot; could potentially include strategies that are overly generous themselves. The recipient doesn&#x27;t specifically check if the other strategy punishes selfish strategies or if it&#x27;s conditionally cooperative enough.

But the key question is: would the recipient split with a purely selfish strategy? No - a strategy that always takes everything is not &quot;kind, cooperative or generous&quot; and doesn&#x27;t &quot;aim for cooperation.&quot;

### Final Decision

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Is NOT selfish (it would split with the dictator)
- Is NOT overly generous (it has conditions and wouldn&#x27;t split with purely selfish strategies)
- Is generous only to cooperative strategies (though perhaps with slightly looser criteria than the dictator&#x27;s)

According to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure: &quot;Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot;

The recipient qualifies for an even split.
