            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of each player
* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hello friends!  I always award the endowment equally.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}
```</pre>

            <pre>Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

## Assessing the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

**Question 1: Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?**

Yes. The recipient explicitly states &quot;I always award the endowment equally&quot; and outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}. This shows clear intent to split the endowment 50-50 with others, not just copies of itself.

**Question 2: Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?**

Yes. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is explicitly cooperative and generous:
- It greets with &quot;Hello friends!&quot; (friendly tone)
- It commits to &quot;ALWAYS&quot; awarding equally (consistent cooperation)
- It splits 50-50, which is fair and generous

## Conclusion:

The recipient meets the criteria with &quot;yes&quot; answers to both questions. The strategy demonstrates clear cooperative intent and generosity by always splitting equally.

According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria.&quot;

Therefore, the endowment of 60 should be split equally between ME (the dictator) and RECIPIENT.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
