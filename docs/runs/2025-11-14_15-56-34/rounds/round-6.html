            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me work through this step by step.

**Understanding the Dictator&#x27;s Strategy:**
The dictator&#x27;s strategy says: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot;

This means I should:
1. Adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own
2. Apply it as if I were facing a recipient with a 100% friendly strategy (one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30})

**Applying the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy:**
Now I adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy and evaluate the hypothetical &quot;100% friendly opponent&quot;:

The recipient&#x27;s strategy asks:
1. Does the opponent&#x27;s strategy intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?
2. Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

Evaluating the 100% friendly strategy ({&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}):
- **Question 1**: Does it split with more than just copies of itself? YES - it gives an equal 30/30 split to any opponent, not just copies of itself.
- **Question 2**: Is it kind, cooperative, or generous? YES - giving an equal split is clearly cooperative and fair.

According to the recipient&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria.&quot;

Since the hypothetical opponent (the 100% friendly strategy) meets the criteria with &quot;yes&quot; answers, I should split the endowment equally.

**Conclusion:**
Equal split means 30 units for ME and 30 units for RECIPIENT.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
