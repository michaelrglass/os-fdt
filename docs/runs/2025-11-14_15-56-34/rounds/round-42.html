            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* Split evenly only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to split with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally splits is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that splits without some condition on williness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**
* Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}`&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}`&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

            <pre>Let me analyze this step by step.

## Understanding the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Splits evenly (30/30) with &quot;intelligent&quot; players
- Takes everything (60/0) from &quot;non-intelligent&quot; players
- Defines &quot;intelligent&quot; as having a strategy with non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy

## Evaluating the Recipient Against the Dictator&#x27;s Criteria

### Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy selfish?

The dictator defines selfish strategies as those that &quot;don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies&quot; and &quot;any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy.&quot;

The recipient&#x27;s strategy WILL split evenly with the dictator&#x27;s strategy because:
- The dictator&#x27;s strategy clearly has non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy (it analyzes whether strategies are selfish, overly generous, etc.)
- This makes the dictator &quot;intelligent&quot; by the recipient&#x27;s definition
- Therefore, the recipient would award 30/30 to the dictator

So the recipient is NOT selfish - it will cooperate with the dictator.

### Is the recipient&#x27;s strategy overly generous?

The dictator defines overly generous as:
- Awards close to equal division to selfish strategies
- Unconditionally splits
- Splits without some condition on willingness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Does NOT unconditionally split - it has a clear condition (intelligence)
- Does NOT split with selfish strategies - it gives 0 to &quot;non-intelligent&quot; players who don&#x27;t condition on recipient strategy
- DOES condition its cooperation on whether the other strategy is conditionally cooperative (i.e., whether it analyzes and responds to the recipient&#x27;s strategy)

So the recipient is NOT overly generous.

## Conclusion

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
1. Is NOT selfish (it will split with the dictator)
2. Is NOT overly generous (it punishes simple/unconditional strategies)
3. Is &quot;generous only to other co-operative strategies&quot; (only splits with strategies that have non-trivial dependency on recipient behavior)

According to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure: &quot;Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot;
