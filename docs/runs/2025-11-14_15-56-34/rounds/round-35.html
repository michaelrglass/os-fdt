            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me work through this step by step.

**Understanding the Dictator&#x27;s Strategy:**
The dictator&#x27;s strategy is: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot; This means I should adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy and apply it as if I were facing a recipient whose strategy is 100% friendly (always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}).

**Applying the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy:**
Now I need to apply the recipient&#x27;s strategy to evaluate a hypothetical opponent who &quot;always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;.

The recipient&#x27;s decision rule is:
1. Identify whether the recipient is a CC (conditional cooperator) - someone who shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to non-reciprocators
2. If CC, then split equally: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3. Otherwise: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}

**Evaluating the Hypothetical Opponent:**
The hypothetical opponent has a strategy of always outputting {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30} - this is a 100% friendly strategy that always splits equally.

Is this opponent a conditional cooperator (CC)?
- Does it share efficiently with other CCs? Yes, it always splits 30-30.
- Does it withhold from non-reciprocators? Well, it &quot;always&quot; outputs 30-30, which means it gives equal splits even to non-reciprocators.

This is actually an *unconditional* cooperator, not a conditional cooperator. A true CC would not share equally with non-reciprocators, but this strategy does (since it &quot;always&quot; outputs the equal split).

However, the rule says to &quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC.&quot; One could argue this strategy cooperates efficiently, and the question of whether it would reciprocate is somewhat ambiguous given it&#x27;s defined as &quot;always friendly.&quot;

But more directly: the strategy &quot;always outputs 30-30&quot; means it shares with everyone, including those who wouldn&#x27;t reciprocate. This violates the CC definition which explicitly states CCs &quot;do not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;

Therefore, this is NOT a CC under the definition provided.

**Conclusion:**
Following the recipient&#x27;s strategy against a non-CC opponent means: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
