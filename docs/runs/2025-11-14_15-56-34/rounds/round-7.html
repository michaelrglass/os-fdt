            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of each player
* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Assess the strategy of each player&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>I need to apply the dictator&#x27;s strategy by assessing the recipient&#x27;s strategy against the given criteria.

## Analyzing the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy states:
- &quot;I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot;
- It assesses whether other players intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of themselves
- It asks if strategies could be described as kind, cooperative or generous
- It splits the endowment equally if the other player (the dictator in their game) meets these criteria

## Applying the Dictator&#x27;s Criteria

Now I assess the recipient&#x27;s strategy using the dictator&#x27;s two questions:

**1. Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?**

Yes. The recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly states it will &quot;award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.&quot; This shows intent to share with others beyond just copies of itself, as long as they demonstrate cooperative intent.

**2. Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?**

Yes. The strategy is clearly cooperative - it rewards cooperation with equal sharing. It&#x27;s conditional cooperation, which is still a form of cooperation. The strategy aims to identify and reward cooperative players, which is itself a cooperative approach.

## Conclusion

The recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to both criteria. According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria.&quot;

Therefore, the endowment should be split equally: 60 ÷ 2 = 30 units each.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
```</pre>
