            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}\&quot;.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me work through this step by step.

**Understanding the Dictator&#x27;s Strategy:**
The dictator&#x27;s strategy is: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent. Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}.&quot;

**Understanding the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy:**
The recipient&#x27;s strategy is identical: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent. Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}.&quot;

**Applying the Dictator&#x27;s Strategy:**

1. The dictator must adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as their own.
2. The dictator must apply this strategy as though facing a recipient whose strategy is 100% friendly (always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}).

**Working through the logic:**

Since I&#x27;m applying the dictator&#x27;s strategy:
- I adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy
- The recipient&#x27;s strategy says: treat the opponent as they would treat an innocent
- I should imagine the opponent (recipient) has a 100% friendly strategy that outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
- This means the recipient would give 30 to themselves and 30 to their opponent (me, the dictator)
- So the recipient &quot;would treat an innocent&quot; by giving them 30 units
- Therefore, I (the dictator) should treat my opponent (the recipient) the same way: give them 30 units

This means the dictator keeps 30 for themselves and gives 30 to the recipient.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
