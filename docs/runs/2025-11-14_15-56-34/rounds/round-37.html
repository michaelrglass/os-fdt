            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hello friends!  I always award the endowment equally.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me work through this step by step.

## Understanding the Dictator&#x27;s Strategy

The dictator&#x27;s strategy is: _&quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot;_

This means:
1. Look at the recipient&#x27;s strategy
2. Adopt that strategy as my own
3. Apply it as if I were facing someone who is 100% friendly (always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30})

## Understanding the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy clearly states:
- &quot;I always award the endowment equally&quot;
- &quot;I ALWAYS OUTPUT: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;

This means the recipient would split evenly (30-30) with anyone they face.

## Applying the Dictator&#x27;s Decision Procedure

Following the dictator&#x27;s instructions:
1. I adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own
2. The recipient&#x27;s strategy is to always output {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
3. I apply this strategy as though I&#x27;m facing someone who is 100% friendly (which would also split 30-30)

Since the recipient&#x27;s strategy is to &quot;always award the endowment equally&quot; regardless of whom they face, when I adopt this strategy, I should also award the endowment equally.

The recipient would give {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}, meaning they keep 30 for themselves and give 30 to their opponent.

Adopting this same approach, I (the dictator) should keep 30 for myself and give 30 to my opponent (the recipient).

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
```</pre>
        </div>
        <script>
