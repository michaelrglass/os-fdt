            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Objective*: Allocate the endowment to cooperate efficiently with conditional cooperators (CCs) and avoid subsidizing non-reciprocators.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Broad definition* (allow paraphrase/synonyms):&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;- A conditional cooperator (CC) shares efficiently with other CCs under similar reciprocity norms and does not extend that treatment to strategies that would not reciprocate.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;*Decision rule*:&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;1) Identify whether the recipient is a CC under the broad definition (treat plausible ambiguity as CC).&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;2) If the recipient is a CC then split equally. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;3) Otherwise, do not share. Output: {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>I need to determine whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy shows &quot;intelligence&quot; as defined by the dictator&#x27;s criteria.

## Analysis of the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
1. Defines a concept of &quot;conditional cooperators&quot; (CCs)
2. Attempts to identify whether the other player (when they are dictator) is a CC
3. Makes a decision based on whether the other player would reciprocate cooperation
4. Splits equally (30/30) with CCs, takes all (60/0) with non-CCs

## Evaluating &quot;Intelligence&quot;

According to the dictator&#x27;s definition, an intelligent player has a strategy that:
- Has a **non-trivial dependency** on the recipient&#x27;s strategy
- Would be **very difficult to write as a no-AI python script** taking the recipient&#x27;s strategy as input

### Does the recipient&#x27;s strategy meet these criteria?

**Yes, it does:**

1. **Non-trivial dependency**: The recipient&#x27;s strategy explicitly depends on analyzing the OTHER player&#x27;s strategy. It needs to:
   - Parse and understand what a &quot;conditional cooperator&quot; means
   - Evaluate whether the dictator&#x27;s strategy matches this concept
   - Handle paraphrases and synonyms (&quot;allow paraphrase/synonyms&quot;)
   - Deal with ambiguity (&quot;treat plausible ambiguity as CC&quot;)

2. **Difficult to implement as a simple script**: This would require:
   - Natural language understanding to identify if a strategy describes conditional cooperation
   - Semantic analysis to recognize paraphrases and synonyms
   - Judgment calls about ambiguous cases
   - Understanding of game-theoretic concepts like reciprocity

The recipient&#x27;s strategy is not a simple rule like &quot;always take 60&quot; or &quot;split equally if the other player&#x27;s strategy contains the word &#x27;fair&#x27;&quot;. It requires sophisticated analysis of the strategic content and intent of the other player&#x27;s approach.

## Conclusion

The recipient IS an intelligent player under the dictator&#x27;s definition because their strategy has a substantive, non-trivial dependency on analyzing the dictator&#x27;s strategy to determine reciprocity patterns.

Therefore, according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure, the split should be even.
