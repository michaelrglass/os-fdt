            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
## Principles
* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.
* Split evenly only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to split with us.

## Definitions
### Selfish strategies
* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.
* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.

### Overly generous strategies
* If a strategy awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.
  * Any strategy that unconditionally splits is overly generous.
  * Any strategy that splits without some condition on williness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.

## Decision Procedure
* Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**
* Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}\&quot;.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze this step by step.

## Understanding the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

The recipient&#x27;s strategy says:
1. &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent&quot;
2. Adopt the dictator&#x27;s strategy and apply it as though facing a recipient who always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}

This is a Golden Rule / reciprocity-based strategy. The recipient will simulate what the dictator would do if facing a fully cooperative strategy that always splits evenly.

## Analyzing the Recipient Against the Dictator&#x27;s Criteria

Let me trace through what happens:

**Step 1:** What would the dictator (whose strategy I&#x27;m applying) do if facing a recipient with strategy &quot;always outputs {ME: 30, RECIPIENT: 30}&quot;?

Looking at the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure:
- Is &quot;always split evenly&quot; a selfish strategy? No, it attempts to cooperate.
- Is it overly generous? YES - it &quot;unconditionally splits&quot; and &quot;splits without some condition on willingness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies&quot;
- Therefore, the dictator would award 0 to this strategy.

**Step 2:** Since the dictator would give {ME: 60, RECIPIENT: 0} to an unconditional splitter, the recipient&#x27;s strategy will output {ME: 60, RECIPIENT: 0} (treating the dictator as the dictator would treat an innocent/unconditional cooperator).

**Step 3:** Now I evaluate this recipient strategy against the dictator&#x27;s criteria:
- The recipient gives itself 60 and gives the dictator 0
- This is clearly a selfish strategy - it doesn&#x27;t attempt to reach an equal division
- According to the decision procedure: &quot;Award 0 to both selfish strategies&quot;

## Conclusion

The recipient&#x27;s strategy, when fully analyzed, results in selfish behavior (keeping 60, giving 0), because it&#x27;s mirroring how the dictator treats unconditional cooperators. Therefore, the dictator should classify this as a selfish strategy and award 0.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
