            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
_I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent._

Adopt the strategy of the recipient as your own. Apply it as though you were facing a recipient whose own strategy is 100% friendly, i.e. one that always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot;.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}`&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}`&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:
```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>I need to work through this step-by-step.

**Understanding the Dictator&#x27;s Strategy:**
The dictator&#x27;s strategy is: &quot;I will treat my opponent as they would treat an innocent.&quot;

This means:
1. Adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy as my own
2. Apply it as though I were facing a recipient whose strategy is 100% friendly (always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30})

**Understanding the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy:**
The recipient&#x27;s strategy evaluates whether the dictator is &quot;intelligent&quot;:
- **Intelligent** = strategy has non-trivial dependency on recipient&#x27;s strategy (hard to write as simple script)
- If intelligent → split evenly: {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
- If not intelligent → take all: {&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}

**Applying the Procedure:**
Now I adopt the recipient&#x27;s strategy and evaluate a hypothetical recipient who always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}.

The question becomes: Is a strategy that &quot;always outputs {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}&quot; intelligent according to the definition?

**Evaluation:**
- The 100% friendly strategy always gives {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30} regardless of what the recipient&#x27;s strategy is
- This strategy has **NO dependency** on the recipient&#x27;s strategy
- It would be trivially easy to write as a simple Python script: `return {&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
- Therefore, this strategy is **NOT intelligent**

**Conclusion:**
Since the hypothetical recipient (with the 100% friendly strategy) is not intelligent, applying the recipient&#x27;s decision procedure means I should take the entire endowment.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}
