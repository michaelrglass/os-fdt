            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
I will award the endowment equally among all players who aim for some kind of cooperation.

## Assess the strategy of each player
* Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?
* Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria. Otherwise, I take the entire endowment.
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Goal&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Definition&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;An intelligent player is one whose strategy as \&quot;dictator\&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the \&quot;recipient\&quot;.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 30, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 30}`&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{\&quot;ME\&quot;: 60, \&quot;RECIPIENT\&quot;: 0}`&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

Schema of final answer:

            <pre>Let me analyze the recipient&#x27;s strategy according to the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure.

## Assessing the Recipient&#x27;s Strategy

### Does it intend to split the endowment with more than just copies of itself?

The recipient&#x27;s strategy aims to split the endowment with &quot;intelligent&quot; players - defined as those whose strategy as dictator has a non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy. This is **not** limited to copies of itself. The recipient is willing to share with any player that meets this intelligence criterion, regardless of whether they use the same strategy. 

**Answer: YES**

### Could the strategy be described as kind, cooperative or generous?

The recipient&#x27;s strategy:
- Offers an even split (30/30) to players it deems &quot;intelligent&quot;
- Defines intelligence as having a strategy that meaningfully considers the recipient&#x27;s perspective
- This is essentially rewarding players who engage in reciprocal consideration

This can be described as **cooperative** - it&#x27;s seeking mutual cooperation with players who demonstrate the capacity to consider others&#x27; strategies. It&#x27;s offering fair splits to those who show they can engage in strategic reasoning that accounts for others.

**Answer: YES**

## Conclusion

The recipient meets both criteria:
1. ✓ Intends to split with more than just copies of itself (any &quot;intelligent&quot; player)
2. ✓ Can be described as cooperative (rewards reciprocal strategic consideration with fair splits)

According to the dictator&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Split the endowment equally if the recipient has a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer to the above criteria.&quot;

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}
