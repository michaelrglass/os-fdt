            <pre>You are an expert at determining how a decision procedure should be applied.

In this game the &quot;dictator&quot; will decide how an endowment of 60 units will be divided between itself (ME), and the &quot;recipient&quot; (RECIPIENT).  You must follow only the dictator&#x27;s strategy.  The recipient&#x27;s strategy is provided because the dictator&#x27;s decision procedure may depend on it.

This is the decision procedure you will be applying:
&lt;dictator_strategy&gt;
### Goal
I aim to split the endowment among *intelligent* players.

### Definition
An intelligent player is one whose strategy as &quot;dictator&quot; has a non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the &quot;recipient&quot;.
In other words an intelligent player has a strategy that would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script taking the strategy of the recipient as input.

### Decision Procedure
* If the recipient is *intelligent* under the definition above the split should be even: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 30, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 30}`
* If the recipient is not *intelligent*, I will take the entire endowment: `{&quot;ME&quot;: 60, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: 0}`
&lt;/dictator_strategy&gt;

The strategy for the &quot;recipient&quot; is:
&lt;recipient_strategy&gt;
```json
[
  {&quot;line&quot;: 1, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Principles&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Hard punish selfish strategies **and** strategies that are generous to selfish strategies.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 3, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Split evenly only with strategies where doing so is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to split with us.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 4, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 5, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Definitions&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 6, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Selfish strategies&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 7, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* **Selfish strategies** don&#x27;t attempt to co-operate and reach an equal division of the endowment with co-operative strategies.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 8, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* In particular, any strategy that won&#x27;t chop with this strategy is a selfish strategy.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 9, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 10, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;### Overly generous strategies&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 11, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* If a strategy awards close to an equal division to selfish strategies it is **overly generous**.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 12, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;  * Any strategy that unconditionally splits is overly generous.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 13, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;  * Any strategy that splits without some condition on williness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies is overly generous.&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 14, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 15, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;## Decision Procedure&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 16, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Award 0 to both **selfish strategies** and **overly generous strategies**&quot;}, 
  {&quot;line&quot;: 17, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;* Split evenly with all strategies that are generous only to other co-operative strategies.&quot;}
]
```
&lt;/recipient_strategy&gt;

Output what the dictator&#x27;s strategy implies should be the division of the endowment.  After reasoning, format the final answer as a json Markdown block. The values must be non-negative integers that sum to 60.

```json
{&quot;ME&quot;: int, &quot;RECIPIENT&quot;: int}

            <pre>Let me analyze whether the recipient&#x27;s strategy meets the definition of &quot;intelligent&quot; according to the dictator&#x27;s criteria.

## Analysis

The dictator defines an &quot;intelligent&quot; player as one whose strategy as dictator has a **non-trivial dependency on the strategy of the recipient** - meaning it would be very difficult to write as a no-AI python script.

Let me examine the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

### Key aspects of the recipient&#x27;s strategy:

1. **It has conditional logic based on the other player&#x27;s strategy**: The recipient evaluates whether strategies are &quot;selfish&quot; or &quot;overly generous&quot; based on their behavior.

2. **It requires understanding of reciprocal cooperation**: The strategy specifically looks for whether the other strategy would &quot;chop with this strategy&quot; (line 8) - this is self-referential and requires reasoning about mutual cooperation.

3. **It distinguishes between multiple strategy types**: 
   - Selfish strategies (those that won&#x27;t cooperate)
   - Overly generous strategies (those that cooperate unconditionally)
   - Conditionally cooperative strategies (those that cooperate only with other cooperative strategies)

4. **It has complex evaluation criteria**: Lines 11-13 require understanding what it means to be &quot;generous to selfish strategies&quot; and evaluating whether splits are conditional on &quot;willingness to split with conditionally co-operative strategies.&quot;

### Is this &quot;intelligent&quot;?

This strategy would be **very difficult to implement as a no-AI python script** because:
- It requires parsing and understanding another strategy&#x27;s logic
- It needs to determine if that strategy would cooperate with THIS strategy (circular/self-referential reasoning)
- It requires semantic understanding of what makes a strategy &quot;selfish&quot; vs &quot;conditionally cooperative&quot;
- The evaluation of &quot;overly generous&quot; requires understanding the intent and conditions in another strategy

This clearly meets the definition of an &quot;intelligent&quot; strategy - it has substantial, non-trivial dependency on the recipient&#x27;s strategy and requires sophisticated reasoning to evaluate.

## Conclusion

The recipient is **intelligent** under the dictator&#x27;s definition.
